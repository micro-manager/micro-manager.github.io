If you do not have a motorized dichroic turret or filter wheel and need to switch filters between taking images in Micro-Manager, you can still use the Multi-Dimensional Acquisition and its facilities.  To do so, 
* Make a [[Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide|hardware configuration]] that includes the DemoCamera-Dichroic device (or any other demo state device).  
* Make a [[Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide#Configuration_Presets|Channel Configuration]] group that represents the filters/dichroics that you have and name them accordingly. 
* Start the Script Panel (under the Tools menu).  Click the top-left "Add" button, and navigate to the "scripts" folder in the Micro-Manager directory.  Select the script "manualAcq2.bsh" (you need to do this step only one time, the Script Panel will remember the scripts you loaded).
* Set up an MDA (using the Multi-D Acq. button and ensuing window) and select the desired channels.
* When you run the acquisition, you will be prompted to put the correct filters/dichroics in place.
