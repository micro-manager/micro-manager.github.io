Ph.D. Student at Carnegie Mellon University.
Works at the Molecular Biosensor and Imaging Center in the lab of Dr. Marcel Bruchez.
Key Interests: microscopy, instrument integration,
hardware-software interfacing, photochemistry,
single molecule measurements. 
Here for: learning and contributing to micromanager
in any possible way that I can. Since we just
finished integrating 7 vendor components on
our scope, we would like to learn and share the
knowledge on how we can do integration
using Micro-Manager alone.
