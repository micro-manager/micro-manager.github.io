Notes for the SHOT controllers:
* Make sure that the controller is in Host control mode
* Make sure that the INTERFACE of the controller is set to RS232C
* Make sure that the BAUD rate selected in the controller is the same as used here
* Make sure that the DELIMITER in the controller is CRLF
The Micro-Manager adapter will set the step angle to 0.036 degree (S20) resulting in a resolution of 0.1 micron.
