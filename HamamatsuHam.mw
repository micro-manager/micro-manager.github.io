{{Note|Formerly (up to Micro-Manager 1.4.16) there was a legacy [[Hamamatsu]] adapter (developed at UCSF) in addition to the "HamamatsuHam". That adapter will be retired in 1.4.17. It is still included in the OS X version, because HamamatsuHam is not supported on OS X. On Windows, if you have a hardware configuration using Hamamatsu, you will need to create a new hardware configuration using HamamatsuHam.}}

Before configuring the camera, you will need to download and install a recent version of [http://www.dcamapi.com/ DCAM-API]. Make sure to read and follow the camera-specific instructions in the DCAM-API Compatibility Note provided on the same page.

{{Note|Make sure you read the DCAM-API Compatibility Notes (available on the website), and in particular follow the instructions for computer power management settings, if it is applicable to your camera.}}
