This adapter implements Signal I/O micro-manager device, by using NI MDAQ interface. Most (or all) of the newer NI boards should be compatible. NI software (drivers) must be installed. LabView is not required.

Besides NI100X adapter this library contains a PI Z-stage driver that is internally linked to the analog output. For regular use of NI boards please disregard the Z-stage device and do not instantiate it in your setup even if you happen to have a PI stage attached. To use a PI stage refer to a standard PI adapter elsewhere in the micro-manager device list.

The only time that you would want to to use the PI stage driver from this library is for the 2-Photon microscope setup described here:
