This adapter implements Signal I/O micro-manager device, by using NI-DAQmx interface. The version of the NI-DAQmx library used to build this adapter is 9.2. Most (or all) of the newer NI boards should be compatible. NI software (drivers) must be installed. LabView is not required.

The IOChannel property required when adding the devices in the Hardware Configuration Wizard are values that look like "Dev1/AO0" or "Dev1/PFI0". You can get these from the National Instruments utility called "NI MAX" that comes with the DAQmx software (look for "Channel Name").

Besides NI100X adapter this library contains a PI Z-stage driver that is internally linked to the analog output. For regular use of NI boards please disregard the Z-stage device and do not instantiate it in your setup even if you happen to have a PI stage attached. To use a PI stage refer to a standard PI adapter elsewhere in the micro-manager device list.

The only time that you would want to to use the PI stage driver from this library is for the 2-Photon microscope setup described in
