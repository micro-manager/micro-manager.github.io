This adapter communicates to all the devices in the TI through the TIScope.  Thus, to use any of these devices, you will need to first define the TISCopedevice.   

This adapter uses the driver and API supplied by Nikon. The latest version of TI Tool (which includes a driver for the TI microscope) can be downloaded from the [http://www.nikon-instruments.jp/eng/service/download/DLList.aspx?CID=3  Nikon website]

Support for control of the HalogenLamp ('DiaLamp') was added in version 1.3.18.  The Halogenlamp cannot be controlled simultaneously using the dial and button on the scope and through the computer.  To switch between manual and computer control use the property 'ComputerControl'.  Lamp intensities set through manual control and through computer control are completely independent (i.e., when setting lamp intensity using the dial on the scope and switching to computer control, light intensity will be different). 

It is possible to control the IntensiLight epi-fluorescence light source to the Nikon TI.  If you want to control the IntensiLight with Micro-Manager, you can either connect it directly to the computer, or you can attach it to the Nikon TI controller.  In the latter case, you will need to go into TI Tools -> setting, click on "Connection", select the left most icon, set the connected shutter to IntensiLight and type to Epi (I had mine attached to shutter 2).  Now, you can control the shutter with the Epi Shutter button on the microscope.  You can now use the EpiShutter Nikon TI device in Micro-Manager to control the IntensiLight shutter.  Note that you will not be able to control the ND filters this way.

As of version 1.3.43, Micro-Manager works with Nikon TI driver 2.0.2 and higher (included with TI Tool 4.0).
