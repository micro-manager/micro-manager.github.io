This adapter communicates to all the devices in the TI through the TIScope.  Thus, to use any of these devices, you will need to first define the TISCopedevice.   

This adapter uses the driver and API supplied by Nikon.  If these are not installed on your system, please contact us. 

Support for control of the HalogenLamp ('DiaLamp') was added in version 1.3.18.  The Halogenlamp cannot be controlled simultaneously using the dial and button on the scope and through the computer.  To switch between manual and computer control use the property 'ComputerControl'.  Lamp intensities set through manual control and through computer control are completely independent (i.e., when setting lamp intensity using the dial on the scope and switching to computer control, light intensity will be different).
