This adapter communicates to all the devices in the Ti through the TIScope hub device.  Thus, to use any of these devices, you will need to first define the TIScope device.   

== Installation ==

This adapter uses the driver and API supplied by Nikon. The latest version of Ti Setup Tool (which includes a driver for the Ti microscope) can be downloaded from the [http://www.nikon-instruments.jp/eng/service/download/DLList.aspx?CID=3  Nikon website].

The required Nikon driver and interface libraries can also be installed using our own (experimental, untested) installer:<br />
[[Media:TiSDKRedist32-4.4.1.672.zip|32-bit version 4.4.1.672]],
[[Media:TiSDKRedist64-4.4.1.672.zip|64-bit version 4.4.1.672]]<br />
To uninstall either of these packages, go to the Programs and Features control panel; the package should be listed with Micro-Manager as Publisher. '''These don't work yet - new files will be posted when issues are resolved.'''

Whichever way you install the drivers, it is best to uninstall any previously installed version, so that you are sure you are using the version you installed (especially if you are troubleshooting).

== Device-specific notes ==

Support for control of the HalogenLamp ('DiaLamp') was added in version 1.3.18.  The Halogenlamp cannot be controlled simultaneously using the dial and button on the scope and through the computer.  To switch between manual and computer control use the property 'ComputerControl'.  Lamp intensities set through manual control and through computer control are completely independent (i.e., when setting lamp intensity using the dial on the scope and switching to computer control, light intensity will be different). 

It is possible to control the IntensiLight epi-fluorescence light source to the Nikon Ti.  If you want to control the IntensiLight with Micro-Manager, you can either connect it directly to the computer, or you can attach it to the Nikon Ti controller.  In the latter case, you will need to go into Ti Tools -> setting, click on "Connection", select the left most icon, set the connected shutter to IntensiLight and type to Epi (I had mine attached to shutter 2).  Now, you can control the shutter with the Epi Shutter button on the microscope.  You can now use the EpiShutter Nikon Ti device in Micro-Manager to control the IntensiLight shutter.  Note that you will not be able to control the ND filters this way.

Note that the tube lens switcher of the Nikon Ti is not encoded.  You can encode the tube lens switcher yourself following these instructions: [[Encoding_the_Nikon_TI_Eclipse_tube_lens]].

In our experience, movement of the dichroic turret (Filter Block) cuases significant vibrations in the microscope.  This causes Micro-Manager to take blurry images.  To avoid this, add a delay (setp 4 of the hardware configuration wizard) to the FilterBlock device.  A delay of 250 msec seems to work well.
