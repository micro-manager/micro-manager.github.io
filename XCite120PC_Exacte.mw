The Lumen Dynamics X-Cite® 120PC and ''exacte'' are computer controlled, remotely positioned (liquid light guide) light sources for UV/Visible microscopy applications.

The X-Cite® 120PC Q microscope light source provides rich spectral fluorescence excitation with a uniformly illuminated field of view, the convenience of pre-aligned lamps, 2000 hour lamp lifetime along with a computer controlled shutter and adjustable iris.

The X-Cite® ''exacte'' microscope light source employs a DC-powered mercury lamp coupled with Closed-Loop Feedback technology to provide stable fluorescence illumination, for imaging protocols lasting from milliseconds to days. With the [http://www.ldgi-xcite.com/products-radiometer.php X-Cite® Radiometer] or [http://www.ldgi-xcite.com/products-xr2100-xp750.php X-Cite® Optical Power Measurement System], light output can also be calibrated in absolute power units (watts), ensuring truly repeatable fluorescence illumination for imaging experiments.


==Installation==

Add the appropriate X-Cite device via the Hardware Configuration Manager

Set serial port timeout to 2000ms

Serial port settings:

*BaudRate 	9600
*Delay 		0
*Handshaking 	Off
*Parity		None

===Exacte===

When using the Exacte with a Mac download the FTDI drivers for the USB-Serial adapter here 

On windows, ensure that you have installed both the USB and virtual COM port drivers. To do this, follow these steps:

         i.      Open Control Panel on your computer.

        ii.      Double click the “System” icon.  If you do not see the “System” icon, change your view to Classic View

       iii.      Select the “Hardware” tab.

       iv.      Click the “Device Manager” button.

        v.      With the X-Cite exacte plugged into your USB port and turned on…

       vi.      Verify in the “Universal Serial Bus Controllers” section that you see the “X-Cite exacte” listed without a question mark on the icon to its left.

     vii.      Verify in the “Ports (COM & LPT)” section that you see the “X-Cite exacte” listed without a question mark on the icon to its left.

     viii.      If either device has a question mark on the icon, insert your X-Cite exacte CD.

      ix.      Ensure you have administrator privileges, right click on the device and select “Update Driver…”.

       x.      Follow the on-screen prompts.
