The code for this adapter was written by Karl Hoover. Notes: You'll need to install the optional Twain software that comes with your camera. In this process, you'll also need to install TWAINDSM.DLL, which is the Twain data source manager. The latest version of the DSM is available at Sourceforge: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/twain-dsm/files/]  As of 1.3.41b, if the library is not correctly installed, the hardware configuration wizard will show you the following message upon selecting the Twain camera device:
