== PROCEDURE ==

Install latest version of Micromanager (this device adapter was first included in the nightly build of 02/06/2013).
Install Thorlabs camera software and plug camera to your computer.
Test that the camera works with the software provided by Thorlabs.
Run MM and make a config file that uses the device adapter "ThorlabsUSBCamera".


== NOTE ==

Pixel clock(MHz), exposure time and CCDX/Y size are variables that depend on each other and the range of exposure times that can be achieved by the camera will change depending on the value of those other variables. For instance, a lower value of Pixel Clock (MHz) will allow longer exposure times.


The device adapter automatically adjusts the range of values that you can enter so that you don't need to worry about it, but it is good to note that if you want to use the maximum exposure time that the camera can offer, you have to decrease the value of Pixel Clock to its minimum (In the case of the DCC1445M, it is 5 MHz). Changing the CCDX/Y size will only affect the range of exposure time because reading more pixels takes more time, but the camera won't collect more signal per pixel.
