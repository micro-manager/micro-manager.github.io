I am a postdoc at TU Delft pursuing research in biophysics. I did my PhD in Leiden University in single-molecule optics. Now I use micromanager to control a homemade TIRF/widefield microscope. With this microscope, I try to understand how the DNA interacts with a DNA organizational protein - Structural Maintainance of chromose.
