I am a novice user of µManager. I would like to do a simple experiment
using µManager image acquisition. I am controlling a shutter and
acquiring images. The shutter opens and closes when the image is
acquired. Now, during this acquisition, I would like to open a valve
controlled by the Velleman K8061digital line, say line number 3 (or
switch 4). This valve should remain open for a set number of frames (or
time) and then close, while image acquisition continues as before. This
is a simple acquisition. Is there a way I can set it up within Multi D
acquisition tool? Or do I HAVE TO use a script? If so is there a script
that I can get and modify? Can anyone in the user group help me with
this? My email is james@helix.nih.gov Thanks James
