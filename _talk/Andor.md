It would be useful to document e2v image saturation.

# A2D convertor saturated, no blooming
# Pixel wells saturated, vertical blooming
# EM register saturated, horizontal blooming

This would require creating copyright images of the sensor as well as the of specimens to show the different types of saturation.
