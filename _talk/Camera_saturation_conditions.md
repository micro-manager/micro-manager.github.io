## Minor Improvements

  - Illustration of camera parts  
    The [wikipedia e2v
    architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:media/EMCCD2_color_en.svg)
    is a good start, but needs to include the A2D

## Major Improvements

  - Definition / animations of terms

:\*A2D

  - \*EM multiplication

<!-- end list -->

  - Difference images for Vertical and horizontal saturation  
    The horizontal saturation image is not very clear and would look
    better with a difference image (may need more acute saturation
    conditions).
