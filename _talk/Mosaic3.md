Test System Setup

-   Fresh install of Micro-Manager into default root
    `C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager 1.4\` directory (all older root
    directories of Micro-Manager installations were deleted).
-   Did not restart computer after MM installation.
-   `Tools > Hardware Configuration Wizard (HCW)` now shows the Mosaic3
    under "Available Devices". This is noteworthy because in earlier
    versions of MM, the device would show up as "unavailable" until the
    DLLs were copied over.
-   Trying to add the device gives "Error in device Mosaic3: No Mosaic3
    devices found." Of course, none of the Mosaic3 DLLs are present in
    the root directory yet since they are not yet bundled with the
    nightly build.
-   Installed Mosaic SDK 3.4.17.1 from <http://my.andor.com/> from
    `Software > Drivers and 3rd Party > Andor Mosaic 3 SDK`. Selected
    option to repair MSVC++ 2010 installation when prompted by
    installer. Chose not to restart. Installed into default root folder
    `C:\Program Files\Andor Mosaic 3 SDK\`.
-   Copied .sdk\\\*.dll files from root SDK directory to root MM
    directory:
    -   atcore.dll
    -   atdevmosaic3.dll
    -   Mosaic3ApiSharedMfc.dll
    -   Mosaic3SDKWrapper.dll
-   Now Mosaic 3 adds successfully with Mosaic3 DLLs copied to MM root
    directory.
-   Confirmed all 4 DLL files are required for Mosaic3 to initialize
    (renaming any of them adding by adding .bak file extension raises
    the same initialization "Error in device Mosaic3: No Mosaic3 devices
    found." as seen before in HCW).

### Scripting

Ran [Arthur's mask projection script](Mosaic3#scripting "wikilink")
verbatim to project a drawn image without doing any calibration - works
OK.

### Projector Plugin

Button nomenclature used in Projector plugin compared to other software

#### Point and Shoot tab

This feature isn't very useful, since it's locked into using a small
circle ROI and the size and shape cannot be customized.

#### ROIs tab

##### ROI Manager

-   All ROIs are uploaded to the DMD regardless of selection in the
    `ROI Manager`, so it's useful to enable the `Show All` and `Labels`
    checkboxes in the `ROI Manager`.
-   When saving ROIs using `More > Save...`, the highlight selections
    are important; only those ROIs that are highlighted are saved. So to
    save all, one must first {% include Key text="Ctrl" %}+ or
    {% include Key text="Shift" %}+select all ROIs. Individual ROIs get
    saved as .roi files and multiple rois as .zip files.

### Mosaic Alignment

-   To focus the Mosaic epi port focus and DMD lenses:
    -   Set a very long exposure time (say, the maximum, 200 seconds),
        and click on {% include Key text="All Pixels" %} (see Figure A).
        The long exposure time is needed since there does not appear to
        be a way to leave a Mask image continuously on; even the
        {% include Key text="On" %} button pulses the image for the
        duration of `Mosaic3-Exposure`.
    -   Close down the Mosaic field diaphram (Figure C) and focus the
        Mosaic epi port lens:
        -   8206 model has the field diaphram built into the
            beamsplitter block.
        -   8204 model uses the Zeiss microscope epi field stop.
        -   Other models need a mask slide placed at the Mosaic epi port
            mouth and focused with e.g. the Mosaic flashlight.
    -   Adjust the DMD lens focus. Using [Arthur's mask projection
        script](Mosaic3#scripting "wikilink") is especially helpful
        here, with a quadrant mask image (Figure D).
