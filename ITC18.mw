The ITC18 from Heka is a 16bit data acquisition device. It has the benefit that it can run asynchronously from the host computer, as well as being electrical isolated. 

It has the following ports:

On the front panel:
<ul>
<li>4 DA</li>
<li>8 AD</li>
<li>4 TTL Out</li>
<li>4 TTL In</li>
</ul>

In addition, more TTL inputs and outputs can be found on the back panel.

Linux implementation is limited to using the USB18 to control the ITC18.
32 bit windows version should work with either the USB18 or the PCI18. It will '''not''' be compatible with 64 bit Windows.

The ITC18 can be used to control anything that either needs Â±10Volts or a TTL signal, including shutters, triggering cameras, pifocs, etc...and everything can be done synchronously with high accuracy.

The ITC18 can be used in two modes. The normal mode is to use it to open or close shutters, or setting or reading a voltage on one of the DA/AD ports. In this mode, it acts like any other device adapter.

The second mode is used by preloading the ITC18 with an imaging protocol, via Micro-Manager, to drive devices. A example script will be posted soon on how to do this.
