The Mightex SLC LED Driver adapter operates the Mightex SLC series USB universal LED Drivers. Please refer to Mightex SLC LED Driver user manual for details of the modals.

This adapter makes the LED driver usable as a shutter in Micro-Manager. Mightex SLC USB LED Driver is designed as an USB interfaced HID device. The adapter has several properties that can be used to control the LED driver.
Basically, user can select a channel to be active and set its mode and parameters, then user can switch On/Off this active channel (when it's ON, its output will be set as per the setting parameters) on the main GUI of Micro-Manager.
