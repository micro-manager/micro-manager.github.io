The DLL Auto Reloader plugin helps speed up device adapter development. Here's how to use it:

# Once Micro-Manager is running, choose DLL Auto Reloader from the plugins menu.
# Click the single button, and choose a directory where a copy of your device adapter's updated DLLs are saved. This location may be bin_Win32, bin_x64, or the directory where Visual Studio is generating the DLL.

Now, whenever you have made a change to your device adapter, you can compile it, and the plugin will automatically reload the device adapter in your running Micro-Manager instance, so you can immediately test the changes.
