== Introduction ==

From the [http://www.thorlabs.de/software_pages/ViewSoftwarePage.cfm?Code=apt Thorlabs APT page]: The APT family comprises a wide range of motion controller products ranging from small, low-power, single-channel optomechanical drivers (T-Cube Series) to high-power, multi-channel, modular 19" rack nanopositioning systems (the APT Rack System). The APT System Software is a common software platform for all controllers in the APT family.

The ThorlabsAPTStage adapter aims to provide a unified adapter for all the Thorlabs APT stages.

== Requirements ==

The device adapter requires 32-bit Micro-Manager and the APT.dll file, which should be copied to the Micro-manager folder. A zipped version of the file can be downloaded here: [[File:APT.zip]].

== Device support ==

At the moment, the following APT devices / controllers will be recognised, although only the TDC001 stages have been extensively tested. If you have had success with any of these, please amend the wiki or [mailto:egor.zindy@manchester.ac.uk send me an email].

== Homing procedure (preliminary) ==

APT stages must be "homed" first before any further commands can be sent.

For each of the stages defined in micro-manager, create a Group with the "Home" property. Then set the value to 1.
