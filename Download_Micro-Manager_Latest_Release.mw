=== Known issues in 1.4.17 ===

* On OS X 10.8 or later, when opening ImageJ64.app, you may get an error message saying that the application is "damaged". If so, you need to temporarily enable the following setting while opening the application for the first time: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Allow applications downloaded from > Anywhere. Once opened successfully, the error should go away even if you switch back the security setting.
