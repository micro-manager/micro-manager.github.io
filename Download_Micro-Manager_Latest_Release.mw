== Micro-Manager versions ==
Currently, there are 2 usable versions of Micro-Manager: 1.4 and 2.0-gamma.  These versions use the same code to interface to devices, but differ in their user interface, and file reading/saving code.  2.0-gamma is actively developed and maintained.  1.4 is no longer developed (except for the device support and the ASI diSPIM plugin).  If you start using Micro-Manager, it is recommended to use the latest nightly build of 2.0-gamma.

[[Micro-Manager_Version_Archive|(Previous releases)]]

{{Note| Due to security issues on OSX 10.12 and later, Micro-Manager does not start when opening ImageJ. To circumvent this, within the Micro-Manager folder in Applications, hold command and drag ImageJ onto the desktop. Then hold command and drag it back in. Then try running again.  See [[Micro-Manager_Installation_Notes|Installation Notes]].}}

== Nightly Builds ==

Although there has been no official release for quite some time, further development and multiple bug fixes have occurred in the 1.4 branch in parallel with development of 2.0.  Nightly builds are almost always stable and a better choice for most users than the latest official release.

* [https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/~MM/nightlyBuilds/2.0.0-gamma/Windows/ '''Version 2.0-gamma (Windows)'''] (you most likely want the 64-bit version)
