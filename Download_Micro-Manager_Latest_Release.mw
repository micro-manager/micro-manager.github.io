==== New Features in 1.4 ====

* Close integration with ImageJ hyperstacks
** four "dimension sliders": channels, slices, frames, positions
** display of RAM- or disk-based image sets during or after acquisition, including disk-based image sets larger than available RAM
* An image display controls panel (in the main window) that lets you
** easily adjust contrast for each channel
** add a scale bar
** view metadata and add comments for image sets and individual image planes
* A new multi-dimensional acquisition engine (under the hood), including
** a smart sequencer that uses burst acquisition whenever possible
** an image pipeline allowing plugins to process images on the fly
** a flexible metadata system for programmers
* Support for color cameras has been substantially extended. You can now use color cameras in snap, live, acquire, and multi-dimensional acquisition.
* Simplified hardware configuration, including auto-detection and auto-setup of a number of serial devices.
* Data Browser plugin for quickly browsing through Micro-Manager data sets
* Windows native 64-bit support (only some devices are supported)
* Several new supported devices:
** Coherent Sapphire Laser (Karl Hoover and Paul Wiggins)
** GigECamera (David Marshburn, UNC-CH)
** Mac support for SPOT (Erwin Frise)
** Meiji Techno EMZ focus stage (Koen De Vleeschauwer)
** Tethered Cameras (Canon and Nikon) (Koen De Vleeschauwer)
** X-Cite 120PC Exacte (Mission Bay Imaging)
** Image Processor Chain - provides sequencing of C++-based image processors in the Micro-Manager core
* Automated bug reports, available in Help > Report Problem
* Optional automated upload of new configurations to micro-manager.org

(Please note that burst acquisition (formerly a separate utility in 1.3) has been merged with multi-dimensional acquisition -- if you want to do a burst, simply select "Time Points" only and set the time interval to 0.)
