=== Known issues in 1.4.18 ===

* PCO_Camera: There is an issue with setting the ROI with some cameras (pixelfly QE, pixelfly vga, pco.pixelfly_USB, pco.1300, pco.1300 solar, pco.1400, pco.ultraviolet). If you are affected, replace the mmgr_dal_PCO_Camera.dll file in the Micro-Manager folder with the version available [https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/builds/hotfix/1.4.18/20140806/Windows/32bit/mmgr_dal_PCO_Camera.dll here (for 32-bit MM)] or [https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/builds/hotfix/1.4.18/20140806/Windows/64bit/mmgr_dal_PCO_Camera.dll here (for 64-bit MM)]. The issue is also fixed in nightly builds since 20140801.

* Hang when Position List window is open: This can happen (usually during an MDA) with certain devices (e.g. NikonTI). Closing the Position List before starting an acquisition should prevent the hang. Fixed in nightly build of 20140818.

* Changes to the scripting/Java API
** Added new Plugin type, <code>MMProcessorPlugin</code>, for plugins whose purpose is to examine/modify image data in the Image Processor pipeline. See https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Writing_image_processors_for_Micro-Manager for more details. (Chris Weisiger)
** Added the Guava library's Event Bus. Objects can be registered for callbacks using <code>gui.registerForEvents()</code>; see the <code>org.micromanager.api.events</code> package for the list of events that are available. Remember to annotate your functions with <code>@Subscribe</code>.
** Added API functions <code>getImageProcessorPipeline()</code> and <code>setImageProcessorPipeline()</code> (Chris Weisiger)
** Added API function <code>setAcquisitionAddImageAsynchronous(acquisitionName)</code>. This will speed up future calls to <code>gui.addImageToAcquisition()</code>. (Chris Weisiger)
** Added API function <code>getCacheForWindow(ImageWindow)</code> which will return the associated <code>ImageCache</code>. (Chris Weisiger)
** Added new core callback function <code>OnSLMExposure()</code> for when an SLM's exposure time changes (Arthur Edelstein)
** When opening a file from the GUI, the "acquisition" used to load the file data is left resident in memory, allowing its data to be accessed e.g. via <code>gui.getAcquisitionImageCache()</code> (Nico Stuurman)

* Changes to the MMCore API
** MMCore version number is once again maintained (Micro-Manager 1.4.18 ships with MMCore 5.0.3)
** <code>MMEventCallback</code> now has an <code>onSLMExposureChanged()</code> member function (Arthur Edelstein)
** New logging management API (<code>setPrimaryLogFile()</code>, <code>getPrimaryLogFile()</code>, <code>startSecondaryLogFile()</code>, <code>stopSecondaryLogFile()</code>, <code>stderrLogEnabled()</code>) (Mark Tsuchida)
** New <code>getCircularBufferMemoryFootprint()</code> function (Mark Tsuchida)
** The following functions are deprecated and will be removed in the next release: <code>clearLog()</code>, <code>saveLogArchive()</code>, <code>saveLogArchiveWithPreamble()</code>, <code>getBufferIntervalMs()</code>

* Changes to the MMDevice API
** Micro-Manager 1.4.18 requires module interface version 10, device interface version 60.
** The previously deprecated <code>AddavailableDeviceName()</code> function has been removed (use <code>RegisterDevice()</code>)
** Class hierarchy changed for "generic" devices (should not affect device adapter code unless <code>CDeviceBase</code> internals are accessed)
** <code>CDeviceBase::GetPortType()</code> was renamed to <code>GetSerialPortType()</code> to avoid name clash
** <code>g_Keyword_Metadata_Z</code> has been removed (probably never used)
** SLM devices now can issue a notification when the exposure changes
** MMDevice no longer depends on Boost headers
** Device types that were never supported have been removed (CommandDispatch, ProgrammableIO, ImageStreamer)

* Changes of interest to developers
** Micro-Manager 1.4.18 is SVN trunk r13943, 3rdpartypublic r169.
** Removed default access to private members in Beanshell scripts. Call <code>setAccessibility(true)</code> if you need to restore access. (Mark Tsuchida)
** Allow plugins in .class files to be loaded, as long as they are not in packages. (Mark Tsuchida)
** Removed many functions from <code>MMStudioMainFrame</code> that were never used nor exposed in the API. If you have code that relied on one of these methods, let us know. (Chris Weisiger)
** <code>VirtualAcquisitionDisplay</code> has been extensively refactored and moved to the <code>org.micromanager.imagedisplay</code> package. However, if you rely on this module, please let us know, because ideally you shouldn't need to. (Chris Weisiger)
** As part of a project to make the Core object-oriented, MMCore has been refactored to use <code>DeviceInstance</code> objects to manage access to devices (Mark Tsuchida)
** The Core logger (which produces CoreLog) has been completely rewritten, and should longer drop entries during shutdown (Mark Tsuchida)
** Core logging to stderr and the primary log file is not enabled upon CMMCore instantiation; it is explicitly enabled by the application (Mark Tsuchida)
** Building using Ant on Windows now requires running <code>ant -f buildscripts/fetchdeps.xml</code> beforehand to download Ant extensions
