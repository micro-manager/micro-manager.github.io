<h2>In brief<\h2>

In brief:
A TIFF file or group of TIFF files that contain multiple acquired images per a single file. These files conform to the [http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/file-formats/ome-tiff OME-TIFF] specification, allowing them to be easily imported into a variety of analysis applications or anything that utilizes the [http://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats Bio-Formats importer].

Image file stacks are designed to be easily imported into ImageJ without the need for any special reader plugins. A stack file can be dragged onto the ImageJ toolbar and will automatically open as a hyperstack with the same contrast settings used in Micro-Manager. Any acquisition comments typed into the Multi-Dimensional Acquisition window or the comments tab of the main MM GUI can be viewed by pressing "i" with one of these files open in ImageJ.

By default, one file is created per an XY stage position (up to a maximum of 4 GB per file). In the tools-options menu, this can be changed to save all XY positions in a single file. This is especially useful for acquisitions using a large number XY positions. Since OME-TIFFs require that an identical String of XML metadata be embedded in each file in an acquisition, acquisition that have a large number of XY positions with a small amount of data at each waste space on disk by writing the same String of metadata in each file at the acquisitionâ€™s conclusion.
