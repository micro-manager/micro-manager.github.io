You can use Matlab to run and control the Micro-Manager gui and core. Here's how:

'''1.''' In Matlab, type
 >> edit classpath.txt
and add the following lines:
 C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.3/ij.jar
 C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.3/plugins/Micro-Manager/MMCoreJ.jar
 C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.3/plugins/Micro-Manager/MMJ_.jar
 C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.3/plugins/Micro-Manager/bsh-2.0b4.jar
 C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.3/plugins/Micro-Manager/swingx-0.9.5.jar
'''2.''' Again in Matlab, type
 >> edit librarypath.txt
and add the line:
 C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.3
'''3.''' Restart Matlab. Now type the following at the command prompt:
 >> cd 'c:/program files/Micro-Manager-1.3'
 >> import org.micromanager.MMStudioMainFrame;
 >> gui = MMStudioMainFrame(false);
 >> gui.show;
 >> mmc = gui.getCore;
 >> acq = gui.getAcquisitionEngine;
Now you have [http://micro-manager.org/content/doc/mmstudio/org/micromanager/api/ScriptInterface.html gui], [http://micro-manager.org/content/doc/mmcore_api/html/class_c_m_m_core.html mmc], and [http://micro-manager.org/content/doc/mmstudio/org/micromanager/api/AcquisitionEngine.html acq] objects that you can control from Matlab, very similar to how you would in [[Example_Beanshell_scripts|Beanshell scripts]].
