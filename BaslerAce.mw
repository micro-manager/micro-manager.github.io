Because of built in delays in the AxioCam's image acquisition, there is a delay of approximately 200ms between when Micro-Manager sends the command to open the shutter and when the AxioCam's exposure begins. If over exposure of the sample is a concern, it is highly recommended that hardware triggering is used with these cameras. Refer to the below descriptions of hardware triggering to do so (All images and text below Â©2010 Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH. All rights reserved.).


<h2>Trigger-Out</h2>

<p>Via a supplementary cable the AxioCam has the capability of sending out a
TTL trigger pulse to an external device, for example a mechanical shutter. This
trigger pulse can be used to synchronize
the exposure of the camera and the task of the external device, as you can
specify the delay between sending out
the trigger signal and actually starting the acquisition.</p>

<p>To meet the requirements of the device you are using, you can
invert the polarity that you want the
signal to have.</p>

<h2>'''Trigger-In'''</h2>

The exact time of exposure can be triggered from outside the camera. When the trigger-in is enabled and an acquisition function is called, the camera will delay the acquisition and wait for a trigger-in signal to be sent from an external device until it invokes the exposure.
The following graphic demonstrates the two camera models' reaction to the trigger signal when performing a triggered acquisition. An acquisition request is sent out at each '''T''', the acquisition takes place at an '''A''':
