Building micro-manager 1.2 from SVN on MacOSX Leopard MacIntel.
This is the complete sequence that I used to build on 10.5.2
on 2008-04-18.  In principle you can just cd to an appropriate directory and run the script
but I would recommend cut/paste into terminal chunk by chunk.  Note that for libdc1394
(firewire cameras on macosx/linux and perhaps PC)  I have provided both a build from SVN and a 
build from the current stable tarball (2.0.1).

Finally to build Micro-manager you will need an up to date [http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ gnu autotools].  From my experience MacOS X Leopard works out of the box, but on Tiger you will need to update.  

Some optional steps are included that will make you build run on Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) as well (NS, 9/11/2008).

Here are download links for versions I have.

 - [http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.59.tar.gz autoconf 2.59] installed on my Tiger system seems to be fine 
 - [ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/automake-1.10.tar.gz automake 1.10.1] NB automake 1.9.6 fails
 - [http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-1.5.22.tar.gz libtool 1.5.22] later versions presumably ok

Once you are done, make quite sure that you are using the latest versions that you have installed:

  autoconf --version
  libtool --version
  automake --version

Hope it works for you! Greg Jefferis <jefferis@gmail.com>

### N.B. on DebianJohan found that he needed to run  autoconf --install at this point.
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH" # to ensure user compiled swig is used
./configure --with-imagej=/Applications/ImageJ/
# (Optional) To make your build compatible with Tiger (10.4) use:
#./configure --with-imagej=/Applications/ImageJ/ CXXFLAGS="-g -O2 -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -mmacosx-version-min=10.4"
# and for statically-linked components use:
#./configure --with-imagej=/Applications/ImageJ/ --enable-static
make
sudo make install
