This adapter controls the Thorlabs FilterWheel FW102B and FW212B.  A manual can be found  [http://www.thorlabs.com/Thorcat/16600/16667-D02.pdf here].  Note that the filter wheel has a USB connection.  The software that comes with the filterwheel will install a driver for USB to serial converter that appears as a serial port in Micro-Manager.  If such a driver can be found on Mac or Linux, this adapter will work on those platforms too (please share experiences here).

'''Problems with carriage return'''

If you are finding that your filter wheel is not moving it may be due to the carriage return being incorrect.  This can be checked using a serial port monitor.  It should be "\r" (0D in Hex) not "\n\n" (0A 0A in Hex).  If this is the case replace the dll file for the ThorLabs Filter wheel with this one:
