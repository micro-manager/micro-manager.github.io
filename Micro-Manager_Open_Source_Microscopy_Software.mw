Î¼Manager is a software package for control of automated microscopes. It lets you execute common microscope image acquisition strategies such as time-lapses, multi-channel imaging, z-stacks, and combinations thereof. Î¼Manager works with microscopes from all four major manufacturers (Leica, Nikon, Olympus and Zeiss), most scientific-grade cameras and many peripherals (stages, filter wheels, shutters, etc.) used in microscope imaging (check the [http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/MMwiki/index.php/Device_Support  list of supported hardware]). Since Î¼Manager runs as a plugin to [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ ImageJ], image analysis routines are available within the application. Î¼Manager software is available for multiple platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux) and is free. [downloads.php Download] the most recent version (1.3) from our website.

You have a choice of many commercial packages available, too many, perhaps. Some are produced by microscope or camera manufacturers, others by third parties but they all suffer from the same problems: lack of flexibility and proprietary drivers - [case.php?object=Why read more...]

If you like and use ImageJ, if you are new to microscopy, or if you have limited resources, Micro-Manager will be your natural first choice. But if you do have a comfortable budget, or if you are already used to another software package, you'll have to make a decision whether to invest time and energy in Î¼Manager. As with everything else, there are some pros and cons. [case.php?object=ProsAndCons Should you give it a try?]

[[Image:a_pix.gif]]
| class="reg" |
If you are putting together or building a serious, automated microscopy system, open source solutions like this one may be a much better choice than anything else. You can use our default, ImageJ-compatible user interface, or build you own. Micro-Manager will even let you control your microscope from Matlab programs. In any case, whether you can use it right away or not depends on whether your particular hardware is supported. If not, contact us and express your desire. [http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/MMwiki/index.php/Device_Support Check the current hardware list]

EXTENDING Î¼MANAGER[[Image:a_pix.gif]]

|
[[Image:a_pix.gif]]
| class="reg" |
Even if you are not interested in writing software code for your microscope, the [http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/MMweb/overview.php open software architecture] of Î¼Manager will benefit you. For instance, the [https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~arthur/mm_doc/html/class_c_device_base.html Open Device Interface] lets anyone write code to control microscope-related equipment, resulting a large and growing list of [http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/MMwiki/index.php/Device_Support supported equipment]. A [http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/MMwiki/index.php/Script_Panel_GUI scripting interface ] makes it possible to accomplish tasks that can not be execute withing the GUI. Lastly, the Î¼Manager [https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~arthur/mm_doc/html/class_c_m_m_core.html programming interface] can be used from many different environments (including Matlab) to develop new applications, all using the same Î¼Manager Microscope device control.
