This adapter was developed for all pco cameras. To run the adapter with a SensiCam or PixelFly, please install the [http://www.pco.de/de/treiber appropriate windows driver]. In case of a pco.camera please install the driver and copy the interface dll into the MicroManager directory.

For all cameras (SensiCam, PixelFly, pco.camera) please copy the following file into the MicroManager folder:
 pcocnv.dll

In case you've got a pco.camera (driver: http://www.pco.de/de/treiber/) series you'll have to copy the interface dll files to the MicroManager folder.
This file is needed for all pco.camera interfaces:
 sc2_cam.dll

Additionally for the Matrox Cameralink interface:
 sc2_cl_mtx.dll
 clsermtx.dll
 mtxclsermil.dll

Additionally for the National Semiconductor Cameralink interface:
 sc2_cl_nat.dll

All files mentioned above can be found either in the CamWare folder, or the sdk.
