| This Windows driver only works with your LPT1 built-in ParallelPort connector. Daughter ParallelPort cards [http://micro-manager.3463995.n2.nabble.com/Re-Can-m-m-control-two-parallel-ports-separately-td5098589.html will not work] with Micro-Manager.
Consider an [[Device_Support#Communication_ports,_TTLs,_DAQs,_etc.|Arduino or a computer I/O board]] if your computer does not have an LPT1 port.
