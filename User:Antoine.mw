Student in Optics, imaging in international master degree in Marseille (France). Currently working on microscopy setups in UPMC, Paris (France) for a master thesis. Especially interested in biological samples with wide field imaging as structured illumination microscopy. 
I did internships at IPR, Rennes (France) in optical trapping, and in Nantes' hospital in nuclear medicine.
