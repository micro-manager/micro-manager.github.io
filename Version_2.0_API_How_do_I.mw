This page covers how to accomplish many common tasks with the Micro-Manager 2.0 API. It is intended to be a migration assistant for people familiar with the 1.4 API, and a getting-started guide for those who have never written Micro-Manager control code before.

In the below examples, reference will be made to an <code>mm</code> object. This is the Studio interface for Micro-Manager's java layer. It's available as "mm" by default in the Scripting Panel of Micro-Manager, hence the name.

=== Control the core ===

The MMCore is the same as it's always been, so methods for setting hardware properties, snapping images, manually running sequences, etc. are unchanged. You can access the core via

 mm.core()

or

 mm.getCMMCore()
