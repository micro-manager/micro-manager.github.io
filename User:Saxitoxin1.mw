I am an established cardiovascular electrophysiologist interested in understanding the role, biophysical properties and regulation of ion channels in blood vessels and how they regulate excitation-contraction coupling in vascular smooth muscle cells. I use standard micro electrode techniques, patch clamp methodologies and fluorescence imaging (confocal, TIRFM and super resolution microscopy).
