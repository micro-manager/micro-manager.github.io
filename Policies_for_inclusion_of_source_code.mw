We encourage everyone who has written a device adapter module to send their code to us for inclusion in the [https://valelab.ucsf.edu/svn/micromanager2/trunk/ Micro-Manager source code repository].  Please email the source code to [mailto:info@micro-manager.org info@micro-manager.org].  Also do include any libraries or other materials that we will need to build the code (or provide links).  If at all possible, do include a compatible license for your software (most of the code uses either a BSD or LGPL license, it is not possible for us to include GPLd code).  

After addition of your code to our repository, we will send you a username and password that you can use for future changes to the code (using a [http://subversion.tigris.org/ subversion] client).  For companies or individuals who are not comfortable having their code being publicly available, we can host this code in a "Secret" part of our repository that is not publicly visible. In this case, the license merely should give us permission to build and distribute the resulting code.

Also, please do request an account for this website (click on the Log In button), and create a page in the [[Device Support]] section.  Use this page to provide information for users of your equipment to configure and use your device in Micro-Manager (i.e., please do not use this for marketing purposes).
