We encourage everyone who has written a device adapter module to send their code to use for inclusion in the [https://valelab.ucsf.edu/svn/micromanager2/trunk/ Micro-Manager source code repository].  Please email the source code to info at micro-manager.org.  Also do include any libraries or other materials that we will need to build the code (or provide links).  If at all possible, do include a compatible license for your software (most of the code uses either a BSD or LGPL license, it is not possible for us to include GPLd code).  After addition of your code to our repository, we will send you a username and password that you can use for future changes to the code (using a subversion client).  For companies or individuals who are not comfortable having their code being publicly available, we can host this code in a "Secret" part of our repository that is not publicly visible. In this case, the license merely should give us permission to build and distribute the resulting code.
