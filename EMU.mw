Interfaces will now be referred as '''plugins'''.

After validating the choice, the plugin is loaded. EMU also starts the '''configuration wizard'''. Refer to the configuration plugin section on how to use the configuration wizard.

=== Configure plugin ===

Plugins are configured using the configuration wizard, which is accessible by clicking on '''modify configuration''' in the configuration menu:
