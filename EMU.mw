Easier Micro-manager User interface (EMU) loads reconfigurable user interfaces in Micro-manager. This page describes the basics of EMU, refer to the [https://jdeschamps.github.io/EMU-guide/userguide.html user guide] for more details.

== Using EMU ==

User interfaces will now be referred as '''plugins''' for EMU. Each plugin has a certain number of:
* plugin settings
* UI properties
* UI parameters

Beyond loading the plugin, EMU provides a graphical interface to configure plugins.

=== First start ===

Upon starting EMU for the first time, the user must choose an interface to load:

After validating the choice, the plugin is loaded. Since no configuration exists yet, EMU also automatically starts the '''configuration wizard'''. 

=== Configure plugin ===

Plugins are configured using the '''configuration wizard''', which is accessible through the configuration menu by clicking on '''modify configuration''':

The '''configuration wizard''' allows changing aspects of the interface and mapping Micro-manager device properties to UI properties. On the upper part of the wizard's window, the user can set the name of the configuration and show/hide the '''help''' window.

In addition, it features four tabs:
* Plugin settings
* Properties
* Parameters
* Global settings

==== Plugin settings ====

Plugin settings are intended to be general options of the interface. They can for instance be used to hide/show some modules, to set the number of modules or simply give them a name.

==== Properties ====

Third-party:
* [https://github.com/jdeschamps/htSMLM htSMLM], the Ries group SMLM microscope interface. It controls four lasers, multiple filter wheel, a z-stage and features various additional controls. It includes automated activation for SMLM and unsupervised imaging tools.
