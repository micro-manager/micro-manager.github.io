25 years experience in embedded software of one type or another, mostly real-time (with a short foray into mobile phones).  Much of that has involved safety-related software, most notably the safety checker on Ford's original hybrid-electric SUV (which is why hybrid Fords don't do silly things like Priuses!).

Now working at Prior Scientific, mainly focussed on Queensgate nanopositioning products.
