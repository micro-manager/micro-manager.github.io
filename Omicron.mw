The Omicron Laser Controller controls Omicron LuxX®, PhoxX® and BrixX® series lasers as well as lasers integrated in LightHUB® compact laser combiners and SOLE® laser light engines via their serial interfaces. (LuxX® and BrixX® laser modules without a native RS232 port need an optional break-out adaptor). 
In the hardware configuration wizard you will need to add one Omicron Laser Controller object for every “…xX”-laser device you would like to control.

The following laser features and operating modes can be controlled and/or monitored through µ-manager device/property browser:

;Read only properties

*Device type
*Serial number
*Specified power
*Wavelength
*Workinghours
*Temperature baseplate
*Temperature diode
*Error notification

;Read/Write properties

*Laser operation select (turns the laser emission ON or Off)
*Laser operatingmode select (CW, analogue and/or digital modulation, standby)
*Laser CW sub-operatingmode select (ACC-Auto Current Control or APC-Auto Power Control; only available with connected LuxX or BrixX laser module)
*Laser power set-point select (set the laser power level in [mW] or [ %])
*Reset

'''Note:''' Laser emission will be automatically shut off at µ-Manager start up. Laser emission can be turned back on as desired by the “Laser Operation Select” property.

'''Note:''' Laser properties show the values of the last polling, simply click the “Refresh” button of the device/property browser to get the actual values.

'''Note:''' Laser emission will automatically shut off when µ-manager is shut down.
