# first of all, install the current ÂµManager from http://micro-manager.org/downloads.php
# put it into a directory like /Applications/Micro-Manger1.3 for example

cd 
mkdir projects
cd projects
svn checkout https://valelab.ucsf.edu/svn/micromanager2/branches/micromanager1.3
cd micromanager1.3

svn --username YOURNAME --password YOURPASSWORD checkout https://valelab.ucsf.edu/svn/micromanager2/branches/micromanager1.3/SecretDeviceAdapters
autoreconf -i -s --force
