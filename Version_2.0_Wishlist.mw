Things we'd like to do for 2.0 that aren't considered to be blockers.

==== Data API ====

* Implement data processing pipeline.

==== Acquisitions ====

* Remove MMAcquisition objects

==== ScriptInterface ====

* Split up "compat" layer into sub-categories, and move those new sub-categories into new objects
** Stage control (+position list dialog)
** GUI (refreshGUI, snapSingleImage, more?)
** Hardware config
** Config groups
** ...

==== General API ====

* Expose classes/interfaces in the API:
** MMFrame and MMDialog
** MMScriptException
** Various utilities (NumberUtils, JavaUtils, others?)
*** These should be exposed as new top-level "manager" types (e.g. "mm.numbers().foo()" instead of "NumberUtils.foo()")

==== Viewer window ====

* Have instant feedback when a new display window is created, even if there's no images to display yet. Possibly optional? Important for MDA display where there can be a lengthy delay before any images actually arrive.

* Show pixel info display in both pixels and microns?

==== Miscellaneous ====

* Add command to close all open windows (with/without prompt-to-save)
* Font quality on OSX Retina displays is awful
* Be able to tag any MM window as being always-on-top (e.g. for stage control, device properties, main window, some specific plugin...)
* Allow users to customize night/day colors

==== Plugins ====
* Fix up PixelCalibrator?

==== Inspector ====
* MetadataPanel should show any property that has at any point in history (for this dataset) changed, not just changes from one image to the next
* MetadataPanel should allow you to specifically select properties that should always be shown
* Reduce size of hidden histograms?
