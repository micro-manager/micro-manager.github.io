Things we'd like to do for 2.0 that aren't considered to be blockers.

==== Data API ====

* Implement data processing pipeline.
* Move comments out of image metadata and into separate file.
** Have a comments history, with modifications tacking a new (timestamped) entry onto the comments rather than replacing the existing content (a.k.a. history is immutable)

==== Acquisitions ====

* Remove MMAcquisition objects

==== ScriptInterface ====

* Split up "compat" layer into sub-categories, and move those new sub-categories into new objects
** Stage control (+position list dialog)
** GUI (refreshGUI, snapSingleImage, more?)
** Hardware config
** Config groups
** ...

==== General API ====

* Expose classes/interfaces in the API:
** MMFrame and MMDialog
** MMScriptException
** Various utilities (NumberUtils, JavaUtils, others?)
*** These should be exposed as new top-level "manager" types (e.g. "mm.numbers().foo()" instead of "NumberUtils.foo()")
* Add colorblind-friendly section to the color picker (c.f. [http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v8/n6/full/nmeth.1618.html this article])
* Replace MMException/MMScriptException with more descriptive (and non-custom) exceptions

==== Viewer window ====

* Have instant feedback when a new display window is created, even if there's no images to display yet. Possibly optional? Important for MDA display where there can be a lengthy delay before any images actually arrive.

* Show pixel info display in both pixels and microns?
* Add "zoom image to fit window" option and option for smoothly scaling images (i.e. not using ImageJ quantized zoom)
** Should have a menu to select zoom level, turn on/off "snap zoom" (a.k.a. ImageJ zoom), etc.

==== Miscellaneous ====

* Add command to close all open windows (with/without prompt-to-save)
* Be able to tag any MM window as being always-on-top (e.g. for stage control, device properties, main window, some specific plugin...)
* Allow users to customize night/day colors
* Easy keyboard shortcut for the "Copy to System" command (ImageJ's default copy shortcut is an ImageJ-specific concept that doesn't play nicely with e.g. Photoshop)
* Add multiple look-and-feel options including a nighttime option that has dark buttons, table headers, etc.

==== Plugins ====
* Fix up PixelCalibrator?

==== Inspector ====
* MetadataPanel should show any property that has at any point in history (for this dataset) changed, not just changes from one image to the next
* MetadataPanel should allow you to specifically select properties that should always be shown
* Reduce size of hidden histograms?
