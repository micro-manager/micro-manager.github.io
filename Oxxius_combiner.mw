Foreword: This Device Adapter relates to laser combiners only. For stand-alone LaserBoxx sources, refer to the Device Adapter named [[Oxxius]].

==Installation==
* Using the USB port:
The USB port needs to be turned into a virtual serial port. To proceed, connect to the combiner (using Oxxius'GUI for example) and enter the manual command "CDC 1". Reboot the combiner.
Take note of the COM port assigned to your combiner, then use the following parameters in the Hardware Configuration Wizard:
    Answer Timeout: 500
    Baudrate: 115200 (this value is seemingly ignored anyway)
    DataBits: 8
    DelayBetweenCharsMs: 0
    FastUSB to Serial: Disable
    Handshaking: Off
    Parity: None
    StopBits: 1
    Verbose: 1


* Using the Ethernet port:
In needed, use the command "?EIP" to query the IP address of the combiner. Enter it in the connection settings.

==Combiner Hub==
This Hub provides access to the laser sources, the accessories and various components connected to (or mounted in) an Oxxius combiner. The hub's "chidren" are detailed in the following paragraphs.
