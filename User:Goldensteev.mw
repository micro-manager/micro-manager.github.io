I graduated in 2016 from the University of Pierre and Marie Curie (Paris 6) with a Masters Degree in Bioinformatics and modeling (http://www.upmc.fr/en/education/diplomas/sciences_and_technologies/masters/master_of_molecular_and_cellular_biology/bioinformatics_and_modeling_specialization_m2.html). 

Early 2017 i was then hired as an Engineer at InBio, a new INRIA/Pasteur Institute unit (https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/experimental-and-computational-methods-for-modeling-cellular-processes/) to work on Microscopy Automation involving Micromanager among other things.
