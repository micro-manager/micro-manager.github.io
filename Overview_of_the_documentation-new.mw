'''[[Micro-Manager User's Guide|User's Guide:]]''' Here you will find how to navigate through the software's menus, dialogs and also perform basic instrument control and acquisition. The guide assumes you are running the software either in the "demo" mode (default installation), or that you are working with a previously configured hardware setup.

'''[[Micro-Manager Configuration Guide|Configuration Guide:]]''' In order to get  Micro-Manager to work with your particular hardware setup guide will cover in detail how Micro-Manager uses configuration files in textual, human-readable form to load appropriate device drivers and to adapt user interface to particular properties of your hardware setup. You will also details on how to write new configuration files, edit existing files, and troubleshoot configuration-related run-time errors.

'''[[Micro-Manager Programming Guide|Programming Guide:]]''' This guide describes how to use the Micro-Manager programmatic interface (API) and demonstrates how to control the microscope setup from Java/C++ program or from other scripting environments. Micro-Manager is designed to strictly separate the user interface from the functional core module. That means that you can use its comprehensive set of microscope control and image acquisition commands from any Java program or Java-enabled scripting environment, such as Matlab.  The entire API is listed in the [https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~arthur/mm_doc/html/class_c_m_m_core.html API Reference] in auto-generated Doxygen format. Device adapter authors will be intersted in the [https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~arthur/mm_doc/html/class_c_device_base.html Device-API reference].
