=== Introduction === 
The Triggerscope is an Arduino-based devices that provides 16 analog outputs and 16 digital outputs.  These outputs can be used to control equipment such as illumination light sources and z-stages.  Outputs of the Triggerscopes can be directly controlled from the computer using serial commands.  Outputs can also be pre-programmed and then cycled through this program by pulses (for instance generated by a camera) connected to one of the input ports.  This enables fast synchronization between devices. This firmware and device adapter were created for smooth inter-operation between the TriggerScope and Micro-Manager (there also is a [TriggerScope device adapter] for the original TriggerScope firmware).  

=== Firmware Installation ===
This adapter was written for "MM" firmware.  Download from [https://github.com/micro-manager/TriggerScopeMM/] and install using the [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software Arduino IDE].
