'''MMCorePy''' is a python library that wraps the Micro-Manager C++ core (on both Mac and Windows). The library allows you to control microscope hardware from python scripts or a python command line. 

Here is how to get started with the Micro-Manager python library:

# [[Download_Micro-Manager_Latest_Release|Download]] and install Micro-Manager on your computer.
# Familiarize yourself with Micro-Manager and learn how to connect it to your hardware by using the existing Java-based GUI (graphical user interface).
# Install Python and Numpy:
#* Option 1: Python distribution<br>It's convenient to install a distribution which installs Python, numpy and other scientific libraries
#** [http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php Enthought's python distribution (EPD)] includes scientific python modules, GUI frameworks and has package management.  Their full distribution is [http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php free for academic use]  
#* Option 2: Manual<br>Individually install packages for python and other modules
#** Required:
#*** [http://python.org/ python 2.7.x] (python 3.x is not yet supported)
#*** [http://numpy.org/ numpy] (required)
#** Optional:
#*** [http://scipy.org/ scipy] for advanced image processing
#*** [http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ matplotlib] useful for displaying images
#*** [http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/ ipython] a nice interactive python environment
#*** [http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ PIL (Python Imaging Library)] for image processing and file saving
# MMCorePy.py will be located in the main Micro-Manager directory; it requires many library files in that directory (with suffixes like .dll, .so, .pyd) to operate. At present it is necessary to run python from inside the Micro-Manager directory so that these files can be discovered.<!-- You can make the Micro-Manager python wrapper library work from any directory by adding your micro-manager directory to the [http://docs.python.org/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH PYTHONPATH] environment variable. -->

Images returned by calls to an instance of the pythonized Micro-Manager core class ([http://www.micro-manager.org/content/doc/mmcore_api/html/class_c_m_m_core.html CMMCore]) are stored in numpy arrays for convenience, and can be easily displayed by pylab (matplotlib) commands. Here is a short example (using matplotlib) that demonstrates use of the python wrapper to acquire and display an image.

<code><pre>
# Create a Micro-Manager core object:
import MMCorePy
mmc = MMCorePy.CMMCore()

#  Load and initialize the demo camera device:
mmc.loadDevice("cam","DemoCamera","DCam")
mmc.initializeDevice("cam")

# Snap and retrieve an image:
mmc.snapImage()
im1 = mmc.getImage()

# Display the image:
from pylab import *
ion() # Activate interactive mode
figure()
imshow(im1,cmap = cm.gray)
</pre>
</code>

A longer example script, MMCoreWrapDemo.py, is available in the Micro-Manager root directory.
