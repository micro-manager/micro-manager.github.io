Micro-Manager is being developed by Mark Tsuchida at the [https://eliceirilab.org/ Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation at the University of Wisconsin, Madison] with help from [http://valelab.ucsf.edu/external/people/directory.html Nico Stuurman] in the [http://valelab.ucsf.edu laboratory] of [http://valelab.ucsf.edu/external/people/directory.html Ron Vale] at [http://www.ucsf.edu  the University of California San Francisco]. 

Initial software development and architecture was by [http://nenad.amodaj.com Nenad Amodaj]. Others who worked on Micro-Manager are Chris Weisiger, [http://valelab.ucsf.edu/external/people/directory.html Arthur Edelstein], [http://valelab.ucsf.edu/external/people/directory.html Henry Pinkard], [http://valelab.ucsf.edu/external/people/directorypast.html Karl Hoover], [http://valelab.ucsf.edu/external/people/directorypast.html Ziah Dean], and [http://valelab.ucsf.edu/external/people/directorypast.html Oleksiy Danihkhno]. Major contributions to the source code have been made by [http://100ximaging.com 100XImaging]. Many other companies and individuals have contributed code for device control, including ABS Cameras, ASI, Andor, Lumencor, Mad City Labs, Motic, Physik Instrumente, Stanford Photonics, PCO, QImaging, ScopeLED, Karl Bellve, Peter Topor, Ji Yu, Brian Ashcroft, Jeffrey Kuhn, Karl Hoover, and Roy Wollman. The project was initially funded by grants from the Sandler Foundation, grant 5R01EB007187 from the NIH, and is now funded by the [https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-awards-5-million-for-open-source-software-projects-essential-to-science/ CZI's Open source Initiative].

Micro-Manager is built by extensively using other open source components and applications:<br />

Especially important precursor contributions for our project are from Wayne Rasband (ImageJ).

Development of Micro-Manager has only been possible thanks to the endurance of our early beta-testers, i.e. several members of the Vale lab (Eric Griffis, Andrew Carter, Gohta Goshima and others). Many thanks to Kurt Thorn and the [http://nic.ucsf.edu/ Nikon Imaging Center at UCSF] for help, testing, great ideas and suggestions. We are grateful for support (in the form of documentation, information, and/or use of equipment) from many microscope hardware vendors, including ASI, Andor, DVC, Stanford Photonics, Hamamatsu, Prior, Solamer, Nikon, and Zeiss.

And of course, many thanks Ron for making it all happen.
