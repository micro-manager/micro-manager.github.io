== Installation ==

=== USB Driver ===

The MicroPoint controller contains it's own USB-Serial convertor.  If this driver is already installed, nothing further needs to be done.  Otherwise you must install the Andor MicroPoint driver to recognize the USB COM port in the Windows Device Manager. These are publicly available on [http://www.andor.com/my/user/ MyAndor website] under <code>Drivers and 3rd Party > Driver: Micropoint</code>. Yes, you have to register and login to download the file.

== Device Configuration ==

=== Calibration ===

The X and Y galvanometer range of the MicroPoint is often a subset of the the camera field of view; thus laser is targeted within a limited square area on the camera.

FIXME: Illustrate calibration process.

FIXME: Describe range limit and what happens when targeting outside the galvo range.

FIXME: Quick start guide to firing the laser "casually" and using it in experiments.

=== Development support ===
