== Installation ==

=== USB Driver ===

The MicroPoint controller contains it's own USB-Serial convertor.  If this driver is already installed, nothing further needs to be done.  Otherwise you must install the Andor MicroPoint driver to recognize the USB COM port in the Windows Device Manager. These are publicly available on [http://www.andor.com/my/user/ MyAndor website] under <code>Drivers and 3rd Party > Driver: Micropoint</code>. Yes, you have to register and login to download the file.

== Device Configuration ==

The [[Projector|Projector plugin]] operates the Micropoint.  Use the Setup tab to create the calibration for each camera you need to use.  The plugin was originally written for SLM devices, so some functions for the MicroPoint have been shoehorned into the interface.

FIXME: Describe range limit and what happens when targeting outside the galvo range.
