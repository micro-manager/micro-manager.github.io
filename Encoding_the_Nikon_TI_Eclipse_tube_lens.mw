The Nikon TI Eclipse is a fine motorized microscope, however, its designers forgot one little detail.  The tube lens switcher can switch between a 1x and 1.5x tube lens but since it is not encoded there is no way for software controlling the microscope to know what the final magnification of the image is.  Of course, a diligent microscopist will take note of the position of that switch and it is even possible in Micro-Manager to add a "dummy" tube lens switcher, however, more often then not, you will end up in a situation where you are not certain whether you used the 1x or 1.5x tube lens, basically rendering a data set useless.

To remedy this problem, I started encoding the tube lens
