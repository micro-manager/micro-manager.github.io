Each of these Nikon devices is a completely independent devices, so each of these devices will need to be controlled through their own serial port. Serial port settings are standard (but consult the manual to the device).  AnswerTimeoutMs should be set to 2000 ms.

The Z-drive is an add-on 'cup' fitting on the Nikon manual focus drive. The TIRF shutter is the T-LUSU. 


Funny thing about the IntensiLight shutter is that it closes much quicker when you put the unit sideways.  The ND filters in the IntensiLight are supported as of Micro-Manager version 1.3.43.
