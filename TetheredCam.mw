== Description ==

The TetheredCam device driver provides support for Canon and Nikon cameras through third-party commercial software from [http://www.breezesys.com Breezesys]. 

Incomplete list of supported cameras:
*Canon EOS 7D, Canon EOS 60D, Canon EOS 50D, Canon EOS 5D Mark II, Canon EOS 550D/Rebel T2i, Canon EOS 500D/Rebel T1i, Canon EOS 1000D/Rebel XS, Canon EOS 450D/Rebel XSi, Canon EOS 40D, 1Ds Mark III, 1D Mark III, 1D Mark IV. 
*Nikon D7000, Nikon D90, Nikon D5000, Nikon D300, Nikon D300s, Nikon D700, Nikon D3X, Nikon D3s, Nikon D3, Nikon D200, Nikon D80. 
*Canon Powershot G10, G9, G7, SX110 IS, SX100 IS, S5 IS, S3 IS, A640, A620.
See [http://www.breezesys.com Breezesys] for an authoritative list. Camera support may depend upon Microsoft Windows version and camera firmware version used. Camera compatibility can be tested using the trial version of the Breezesys software.

== Installation ==

Installation instructions:
* Go to the [http://www.breezesys.com Breezesys] web site. Verify your camera is supported by [http://www.breezesys.com/PSRemote/index.htm PSRemote] if you have a Canon Powershot, [http://www.breezesys.com/DSLRRemotePro/index.htm DSLRRemote Pro] if you have a Canon DSLR, or [http://www.breezesys.com/NKRemote/index.htm NKRemote] if you have a Nikon DSLR camera.
* Download, install and configure the program which corresponds to your camera (PSRemote, DSLRRemote, or NKRemote). Click on the "Release" button to take a picture. Check the picture is downloaded to the PC, and displayed in the PSRemote/DSLRRemote/NKRemote main window.
* If you're planning to use raw image files, optionally install the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Imaging_Component#External_links Windows Imaging Component codec] for your camera's raw image format.
* With PSRemote, DSLRRemote, or NKRemote still running, start up Micro-Manager.
* Open the Tools menu, and choose Hardware Configuration Wizard.
* In the "Select the configuration file" window: Click on Next.
* In the "Setup COM ports" window: Click on Next.
* In the "Add or remove devices" window: Click on Add.
* In the "Add device" window: Select PSRemoteCamera if you use PSRemote, NKRemoteCamera if you use NKRemote, or DSLRRemoteCamera if you use DSLRRemote. Click on Add. A small window pops up with "Please type in the new device name". Click on OK. Click on Done.
* Back in the "Add or remove devices" window: Click on Next.
* In the "Edit pre-initialisation settings" window: Click on Next.
* In the "Select default devices" window: Choose "CanonPSCam", "NikonDSLRCam" or "CanonDSLRCam" as default camera. Click on Next.
* In the "Set delays for devices without synchronisation capabilities" window: Click on Next.
* In the "Select devices to synchronize with image acquisition" window: Click on Next.
* In the "Define position labels for state devices" window: Click on Next.
* In the "Save configuration" window: Click "Save and test the new configuration". Click on Exit.

You can now use the camera in Micro-Manager.

== Properties==
[[Image:TetheredCam_settings.png]]

The following properties are currently implemented:

;Binning
:Binning groups pixels in both x and y direction. Allowable values are 1, 2, 4, 8.
;BitDepth
:Specifies the bit depth or dynamic range of the pixel. Actual bit depth may be less, depending upon the camera image sensor. Allowable values are "8" and "16".
;Exposure
:Exposure sets the exposure time. Units are ms. Setting the exposure time in Micro-manager requires a properly initialized "ShutterSpeeds" camera property, and DSLRRemote/NKRemote/PSRemote "Exposure mode" set to "Tv" or "Manual".
:An exposure time of 0 leaves the camera shutter speed unchanged. This allows setting the shutter speed in DSLRRemote/NKRemote/PSRemote instead of in Micro-Manager.
;ImageDecoder
:Specifies the preferred decoder for raw images. Allowable values are "Raw", "Raw (no gamma compensation)", "Raw (no gamma compensation; no white balance)" and "Windows".
:;Raw
::Images are decoded using Micro-Manager's internal decoder, [http://www.libraw.org libraw]. The internal decoder is able to decode raw images only, not jpeg. Decoded images are gamma adjusted for sRGB.
:;Raw (no gamma compensation)
::Same as "Raw", but decoded images have a linear grayscale.
:;Raw (no gamma compensation; no white balance)
:: Same as "Raw", but decoded images have a linear grayscale, and have no white balance applied.
:;Windows
::Images are decoded using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Imaging_Component Windows Imaging Component]. The decoder is able to decode jpeg and, if [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Imaging_Component#External_links Windows Imaging Component codecs] have been installed, raw images. 
;KeepOriginals
:Saves the pictures to disk. Allowable values are 0 and 1. The directory can be chosen in DSLRRemote, NKRemote or PSRemote File->Preferences. The pictures are in the format provided by the camera; typically jpeg or raw.
;PixelType
:When set to Grayscale, converts images to grayscale. Allowable values are Color and Grayscale.
;ShutterSpeeds
:If one wishes to set exposure in Micro-Manager, the "Shutter Speeds" property has to contain a list of available shutter speed settings, separated by semicolons. The shutter speeds have to be in the same order as they appear in the "Tv" drop-down box in DSLRRemote/NKRemote/PSRemote. Shutter speeds can be floating point numbers (e.g. 0.25) or fractions (e.g. 1/4). Shutter speeds are expressed in seconds.
:As an example, if a Canon Powershot A80 is used the property "ShutterSpeeds" should be as follows:
:15;13;10;8;6;5;4;3.2;2.5;2;1.6;1.3;1;0.8;0.6;0.5;0.4;0.3;1/4;1/5;1/6;1/8;1/10;1/13;1/15;1/20;1/25;1/30;1/40;1/50;1/60;1/80;1/100;1/125;1/160;1/200;1/250;1/320;1/400;1/500;1/640;1/800;1/1000;1/1250;1/1600;1/2000
;TransposeCorrection
:When set, enables TransposeMirrorX, TransposeMirrorY, TransposeXY. Allowable values are 0 and 1. Transposing is useful if the camera image is not oriented as you would expect.
;TransposeMirrorX
:When set, mirrors image horizontally. Allowable values are 0 and 1.
;TransposeMirrorY
:When set, mirrors image vertically. Allowable values are 0 and 1.
;TransposeXY
:When set, rotates image. Allowable values are 0 and 1.

== Notes ==
Many algorithms in Micro-Manager require grayscale images. Feeding a color image to a grayscale-only algorithm typically produces errors such as "Unsupported pixel type" or "Invalid data type". Setting both "PixelType" to "Grayscale" and "KeepOriginals" to "1" will send a grayscale image to Micro-Manager but allow you to read the original color images from disk.

If you wish to automatically load your "Shutter Speeds" settings upon startup, create a Micro-Manager configuration group called "System". In the "System" configuration group, create a preset group called "Startup" which includes "Shutter Speeds". These settings will be applied every time you start up Micro-Manager.

Select the "Camera" > "Live View" menu in DSLRRemote, NKRemote or PSRemote to get a live view display.
