I'm an Electrical Engineer with a background in video and acoustic technology. 

I'm very interested in confocal techniques applied to brightfield microscopy. My current goal is to explore new techniques to allow near real time high DOF image acquisition using stacked Z-plane images. 

I work with Nikon Eclipse series equipment and I'm currently exploring very high-resolution video imaging of confocal brightfield subjects as well as DIC and darkfield imaging.
