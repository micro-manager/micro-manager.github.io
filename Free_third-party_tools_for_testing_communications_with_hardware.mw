==Device signals analysis==

Competent hardware manufacturer provide detailed, complete documentation on how to programmatically control their devices. In some cases, when good documentation is not available, it is necessary to analyze and test signals being sent between a device and the computer, or between different software components. A number of free tools are available for this purpose:
