The Cobolt laser controller controls compact solid-state lasers.

'''This driver had a major rewrite on April 10, 2020.''' 

'''Max Power''' is still in the code to be backwards compatible with the old Cobolt driver, but it is deprecated and not used.


This new driver supports 115,200 baud as well as the older 19,200, with automatic serial port detection.

===The serial port===
* 115,200 or 19200 baud, 
* no flow control, 
* one stop bit
* no parity
* 8 data bits
* delaybetweenChars 0 ms. 

=== Device Properties===

The new driver supports constant current, constant power, and modulation modes. Also, you can select Analog or Digital modulation. The ability to enable/disable Autostart is now supported. There is also direct serial communication supported via '''Serial Command'''

== Linux udev Rule ==

As Root, create a file named /etc/udev/rules.d/99-Cobolt.rules with the following context:

 # allow users to claim the device
 SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{product}=="Cobolt Laser Driver MLD",  ATTRS{idVendor}=="25dc", MODE="0660", GROUP="users", SYMLINK+="ACM%n"

== Notes ==

{{Note|Lasers will ignore the power setting for a few minutes while they start up. Reset after warm up is over}}

A useful device for control of additional laser shutter can be an [[Arduino]] board; a way to integrate hardware and software may be build a GUI panel to  control easily laser power and shutter devices:
