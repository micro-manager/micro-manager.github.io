The Cobolt laser controller controls compact solid-state lasers.

Before adding this device adapter, confirm that you have serial communication with the laser controller by using a terminal. The serial port should be set at set at 19200 baud, no flow control, one stop bit, no parity, 8 data bits, delaybetweenChars 0 ms. The laser controller should respond to the following commands: l?, p?, hrs? (Laser on/off, power, hours). If you do not get a response then the Micro-Manager Cobolt device adapter will not work.

In the configuration wizard you will need to add one Cobolt object for every Cobolt laser you would like to control. 

The following commands are available with this device adapter:
<ul>
    <li>Laser Power (Read/Write)
    <li>Laser On/Off (Read/Write)
    <li>Laser Status (Read only)
    <li>Hours (Read only)
    <li>Serial Number (Read only)
    <li>Interlock state (Read only)
    <li>Current (Read only)
    <li>Errors (Read only)
</ul>

    '''NOTE: Lasers will automatically be shut off when Micro-Manager closes but power remains on.'''
    '''NOTE: Lasers will ignore the power setting for a few minutes while they start up. Reset after warm up is over'''
    '''NOTE: This driver works best with laser controller firmware version 13'''
