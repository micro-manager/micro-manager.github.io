The Aurora laser launch from Prairie[http://www.prairie-technologies.com/products/laser/Aurora.html] is a solid-state laser system that can be used for fast acquisition using multiple LASER lines. It can be integrated with most microscopes using custom software such as Metamorph [http://www.moleculardevices.com/Products/Software/Meta-Imaging-Series/MetaMorph.html], using the electronic slider box that one can purchase from Prairie for ~2500 USD. Using it with Micro-Manager[http://micro-manager.org/], however, proves to be way more economical and easier. In this article, we will discuss a step by step procedure for integrating the LASER launch with Micro-Manager, starting from hardware setup to software-hardware interfacing.


== Before you Get started: ==

There are a few things worth knowing about the integration before you get started. The Laser launch is designed to interface with other devices using a DB-25 pin connector at its back. You should find out the pins that connect to individual laser lines and control them (See Figure). The DB-25 pin will not connect to a parallel port on your computer directly. You will need an extended USB-interface board like the Velleman VM 140, which will interface with the AOTF and your computer. Thankfully, there is a Micro-Manager adapter for the Velleman interface boards (K8061) that makes life easier for this integration.
