This device adapter was written by Karl Hoover and will provide higher performance than the TWAIN interface. To use Leica DFC FX cameras you'll need the Baumer Optronics software including FxLib.dll, this is available from your vendor.

Since version 1.4.8 (20120224), this adapter is build using the Baumer SDK 1.7.  This SDK is freely available from: [http://www.baumer.com/us-en/products/identification-image-processing/software-and-starter-kits/baumer-gapi/ Baumer].

Tested with a Leica DFC345 FX and a Leica DFC425 on Windows XP 32 bit and Windows 7 64 bit (2012-02-24).

Note that not all Leica cameras are Baumer cameras.  For instance, the DFC500and DFC550 will not work with this adapter.
