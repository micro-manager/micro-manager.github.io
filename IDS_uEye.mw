Requires drivers from IDS (version 4.30 or higher), which can be downloaded from the [http://en.ids-imaging.com/download-ueye.html IDS site].


=== Features ===
* Supports monochrome and color cameras. The available modes/bit depths can be selected in the properties browser ("Pixel Type").

=== Notes ===
* For color, currently only the modes "BGRA8" and "RGBA8" are supported.
* The "Frame rate" property will not necessarily affect the real frame rate in the live-mode for every camera model. It does, however, determine the maximal exposure time.
* If several cameras are connected, currently only the first camera in the list will be addressed.
* With Linux and OpenJDK, using the color modes may cause problems (monochrome modes work), with Sun/Oracle JDK all modes work.
