A senior engineering manager and highly experienced electronics and software engineer with a broad range of skills and disciplines. Until a while working in a substantially matrix-managed ISO9000 design and manufacturing environment on multiple sites in the UK and Germany. The role was substantially senior managerial, however in that modest sized company it also included hands-on engineering when appropriate.

Now working for CoolLED Limited as their entire electronics and software team, so there's nobody to manage.

Past life includes extensive radio and wired communications experience.
