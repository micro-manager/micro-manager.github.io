I obtained the Degree in Physics in 2007 at Universidad Nacional de
Córdoba (Argentina), and the PhD in Physics in 2012 at Universidad
Nacional del Litoral (Argentina). Currently I'm working as a Professor
and Staff Researcher at the Instituto de Física del Litoral (Santa Fe,
Argentina) and at the Universidad Tecnológica Nacional. My research
activities are centered on amorphous, polycrystalline and crystalline
silicon for photovoltaic applications and on digital holography and
digital holographic interferometry for non-destructive testing of
materials.
