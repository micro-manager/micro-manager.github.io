I am a Ph.D. Student at Carnegie Mellon University.
I work at the Molecular Biosensor and Imaging Center[http://www.mbic.cmu.edu/index.html] in the lab of Dr. Marcel Bruchez[http://www.chem.cmu.edu/groups/bruchez/index.html].
My main interests include photochemistry, microscopy, single molecule measurements, instrument integration,
hardware-software interfacing. I am primarily here for learning and contributing to Micro-Manager in any possible way that I can. I can be reached at ssaurabh@andrew.cmu.edu for any questions.
