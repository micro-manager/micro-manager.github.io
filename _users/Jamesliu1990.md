I am currently a PhD student at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Georgia. I am currently working on developing optical imaging method for large biological samples. More specifically, I am working on Light sheet microscopy for neurological studies. I worked as a continuous improvement engineer doing research and development for the spectrophotometer devices produced by On-Line Instrument Systems, Inc. My undergraduate degree, also from UGA, is a B.S. in biological engineering with an emphasis on biomedical instrumentation. I am also fluent in Mandarin Chinese.
