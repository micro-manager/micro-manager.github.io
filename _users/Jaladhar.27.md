I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Chemistry, IIT Bombay. I am
using Single Molecule Imaging and Spatially Resolved Imaging and
Spectroscopy to probe the different heterogeneous system like polymers,
amyloid filaments/fibrils relevant for neurodegenerative diseases/ gels
etc. Among the different SM approach I utilized the SM dynamics, SM
Spectroscopy and Polarisation resolved SM imaging.
