I work at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell biology and Genetics in Dresden Germany in Dr. Pavel Tomancak's group, and am currently in the process of building a Open-Source Selective Plane Illumination Microscope (SPIM). I would really like to use your software to drive it. The plans to set up the system will be uploaded to the net as soon as I am finished with the project, including links to download all the necessary software.
