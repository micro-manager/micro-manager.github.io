Former Andor senior software engineer, currently working as a freelance software engineer.

I first worked on Andor iQ and Bitplane Imaris before joining the third-party and OEM software support team. During my time in the support team I helped in the creation and maintenance of device adapters for various applications including Micro-Manager.
