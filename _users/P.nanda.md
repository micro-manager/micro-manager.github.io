== About ==
My name is Pariksheet Nanda and you're probably reading this to find out who I am and/or why I care so much about µManager.

The short version is: I love programming; I first got involved with the software freedom culture (mostly Gentoo GNU/Linux) in the months between graduating and finding employment at Andor, and so µManager allowed me to reconcile my hobbies with my professional life.

I got my college degree in Electrical Engineering, and then joined Andor Technology as a Support Engineer.  I worked briefly with the camera and spectroscopy division for a few months before settling into the company's newer, exciting microscopy systems division.  It was fun not only because of traveling for field work and being able to meet clients face-to-face, but also being able to work closely with nearly all departments of the company with their highly motivated people.  After 6 years, the US systems division staff had grown 4 times, and it was a good time to leave for academia with so many wonderful people to continue the journey.  Having PhD students and professors as clients showed me the edifying experience that the educational environment has on character, and for that my own academic interests I joined the academic research community at a microscopy development lab.
<!--
The first exposure I had to the µManager project was meeting Nico Stuurman at Woods Hole.  I had come up with Chris Calling (Andor's US President at the time) to check that our loaned cameras were running fine.  

one plays the Sisyphean role of helping researchers use unfamiliar equipment, or aiding the ~4 year cycle of getting new lab students and postdocs back up and running on their systems.

I have a hardware background and spend most of my time writing documentation and helping users.

In general, free and open source software communities are rich in altruism and people enjoying their work.  Over many days and years, other developers on IRC channels have spoiled me with their kindness, answering my many questions, which made me feel the need to emulate them.  Years ago, I started filing bug reports for the Gentoo GNU/Linux, and became good at doing that which made me good at applying the collaborative development workflow (issue tracker, code version control, wiki) to my own small projects.  Being a part of the free software community is a gradual process of joining a culture and learning new things.  Going to conferences and meeting other friendly people and developers recharge my batteries and keeps me going on my own projects.

The community you all created is also a professional development resource.

and I hope to one day see MM focused meat space meetings. -->

Personal Goals with µManager
# Improve documentation on this wiki.
# Setup µManager to give users freedom running their complex imaging microscopes.
# Promote the project to attract programmers and funding from other industries:  particularly by adding GNU/Linux packages to official µManager releases and the [http://directory.fsf.org/wiki?title=Review:Micro-Manager-REV-ID-1&redirect=no FSF Directory].
# Get more familiar with the programming API.

== Systems Setup ==
Over the years, I've helped a number of students and professors get setup with µManager:

== Acknowledgements ==
I wish to thank Steve Ikeda (NIH) for training me on what practical setups for Groups and Presets should be, since that generic mode of interface organization was new to me.  Organizing Device Properties in a sane way paid off many times over in helping other users set up their systems.

I also would like to thank Paul Forscher (Yale) for teaching me the canonical troubleshooting approach (the nabble search web link), showing me how he setup and ran his systems with Matlab, and his extensive involvement and patience in wading through intermittent hardware communication problems.

Finally, I would like to thank Nico Stuurman (UCSF) for accepting my patches and granting me repository access to maintain a part of the C++ code.  Contributing code to an active project I really cared about was a huge confidence boost for me and I felt like I made it as a free software programmer, as well as become part of the community.
