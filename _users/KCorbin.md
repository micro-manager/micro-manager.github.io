Managing Director, Biological Imaging Development Center (BIDC) at UCSF.
We house and maintain close to a dozen microscopes; working primarily on
home-built 2-photon scanning systems running MicroManager through custom
plug-ins that are now in use on other scanning systems. Our focus is on
bringing emerging light microscopy techniques to UCSF and supporting
researchers in their imaging.
