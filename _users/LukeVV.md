I'm a PhD student of Molecular Engineering at University of Washington.
I come from Taiwan. Currently, my research is about the hybrid
perovskite materials. I'm working to built up an microscope system with
Micro-Manager so that I can do PL measurement on my samples. I hope I
can find help here to accomplish the microscope system.
