CoolLED designs and manufactures cutting edge LED Illumination Systems for researchers and clinicians using the latest LED technology.

The company has specialised in fluorescence microscopy since it introduced the first commercially available LED Illumination System in 2006. 

LED microscope lighting is now the method of choice because these systems are more stable, longer lasting, and energy efficient than traditional mercury based illuminators as well as offering superior safety and environmental features.
