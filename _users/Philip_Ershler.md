I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (Bioengineering) from the University of Utah in 1986. I have been an Associate Research Professor in Internal Medicine at the University of Utah since 1986. I participated in the design and have written software for numerous high speed data acquisition and storage system over the years. Within the last 10 years I have become the P.I. of our confocal microscopy facility. We have two commercial confocal systems. Our first was a BioRad MRC 1024. In addition we have Zeiss system equipped with an LSM 510 scan head as well as a 5 Live High speed scan head. We use a UV laser for uncaging proton and calcium ions. We also have one confocal system that was designed and built in house.
