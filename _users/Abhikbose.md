Phd Student working on real time single molecule imaging. Obtained msc on fluorescence based imaging and microscopy not at a sngle molecule lavel. Now trying to implement micromanager with DVC camera 1412AM. But I think its supports previous versions of micromanager only which are not available for download right now. so trying to sign up for an account, so to perform it in better way.
