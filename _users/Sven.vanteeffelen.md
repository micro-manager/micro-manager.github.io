I am a group leader of team at the Institut Pasteur in Paris working on growth of bacteria using microscopy.  I have previously worked as a postdoc at Princeton University (Molecular Biology Department) and before that as a physicist in theoretical soft condensed matter physics.  We are interested in imaging sub-cellular structures and protein-localization in bacteria.
