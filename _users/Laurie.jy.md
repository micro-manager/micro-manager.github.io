I'm a second year PhD student here in the Laser Analytics Group, Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology at the University of Cambridge, UK. I'm in the process of developing a TIRF and super resolution microscope based on Gustafsson's structured illumination microscopy using a spatial light modulator, controlled and automated using Micro-manager.
