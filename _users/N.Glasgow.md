I am a Software Developer working at Andor Technology since December 2007. I have worked in a number of different roles with the Software Team, and quite recently have been helping out with Third Party Integration. I have some experience in Microscopy techniques, and how the Software interacts with the Hardware to achieve desired result and enable further analysis of the acquired data.
