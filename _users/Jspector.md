Obtained a BS in Physics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a
PhD in physics under the guidance of Dr. Ken Ritchie. I was a postdoc
for 2 years at NIST in the US and am now a postdoctoral researcher in
the lab of Dr. Roll-Mecak at the NIH. I have setup and run micromanager
on over 10 microscopy platforms and firmly support their open access
philosophy.
