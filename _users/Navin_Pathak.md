I am a student at Rice university majoring in bioengineering and am currently working at Dr. Wen-Hong Li's lab in UT Southwestern through the SURF internship program. Our lab is focusing on fluorescence microscopy and is using micro-manager to coordinate the system. Although I have little programming experience of my own, I will be taking various classes on MATLAB and python throughout my undergrad years.
