I am currently a fluorescence microscopy specialist in the Dyche Mullins
lab at UCSF. I keep all the microscopes running and help graduate
students and postdocs get the most out of their imaging.

I was previously a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley, where I
worked with a team of chemists, biologists, and engineers to use
fluorescence microscopy to reveal the the biophysical underpinnings of
cell-cell signaling. I have a PhD in Chemistry from Stanford University,
where I worked in the Moerner Lab designing and characterizing
fluorophores for single-molecule microscopy in living cells.

Specialties: biophysics, supported lipid bilayers, single-molecule
spectroscopy, microscopy, spectroscopy, cell imaging, fluorophore
design, atomic-force microscopy, polymer physics
