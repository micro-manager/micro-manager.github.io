Andrey Karpov is technical director of the OOO "Program Verification Systems" company where his task is to develop source code static analyzers. He has worked for several years in the "CFD Software Group" Scientific Center where he has acquired an exceptional experience of resource-intensive software development in the sphere of computational modeling and visualization. It was there that he noticed an insufficient set of tools for detecting defects in 64-bit software handling large memory amounts. It became the starting point in creation of the Viva64 static analyzer and later the PVS-Studio package.
