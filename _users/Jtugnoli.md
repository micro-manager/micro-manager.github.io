Software engineer at First Light Imaging, a french society where we made SWIR cameras.
My job is to develop an unified SDK using C++ for all the cameras and to do wrappers for others languages like C, Python, LabView and plugins for some exploitation software like MicroManager.
A proprietary exploitation software is currently developed using C++/Qt.
