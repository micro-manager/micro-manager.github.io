I am a Staff Scientist in the Harvard Center for Advanced imaging. The
Center performs basic research in microscopy with goal of improving
existing imaging techniques and developing new imaging techniques. My
personal area of interest is super-resolution imaging using single
molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). I work on improving both the
hardware and the analysis software for this approach. In addition I
collaborate to a limited extent with members of the Zhuang group who use
microscopes that I have assembled, or helped assemble, for their
experiments in the areas of SMLM imaging and also MERFISH imaging.
