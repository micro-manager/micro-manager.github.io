I am a software engineer at Vortran Laser Technology. I have developed Micro-Manager device adapters for the Vortran Stradus Laser Diode Module and VersaLase products. My goal is to provide Micro-Manager users with a reliable interface to these products. Please feel free to contact sales@vortranlaser.com for questions or comments regarding the device adapters.
