I am a biophysicist working at the interface of single molecule
microscopy (PALM/ STORM) and microbiology. I obtained my DPhil in the
laboratory of Dr Achillefs Kapanidis at the University of Oxford, UK,
working on method development in single molecule microscopy and FRET. I
now work as a post-doctoral researcher in the laboratory of Prof Suliana
Manley at EPFL, Switzerland.

My current research focuses on using single molecule microscopy to study
the dynamics of sub-cellular protein localisation in bacteria.
