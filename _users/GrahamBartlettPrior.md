25 years experience in embedded software of one type or another, mostly
real-time (with a short foray into mobile phones). A fair amount of that
has involved safety-related software, most notably the safety checker on
Ford's original hybrid-electric SUV (which is why hybrid Fords don't do
silly things like Priuses\!).

Now working at Prior Scientific, mainly focussed on Queensgate
nanopositioning products.

For questions about Prior device adapters, please use the [mailing
list](Micro-Manager_Community "wikilink"). For any other questions,
please go to [Prior.com](https://www.prior.com) and email our UK
enquiries contact, who will forward any relevant enquiries to me. (Or if
you're reading this at some point in the future, potentially to my
successor.)
