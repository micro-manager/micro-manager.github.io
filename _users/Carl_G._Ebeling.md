Graduate student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Utah under Dr. Jordan Gerton. While much of Dr. Gerton's work involves near-field optics, I am working in the optical far-field regime, more specifically in super-resolution microscopy. I also work in the lab of Dr. Erik Jorgensen in the Department of Biology at the University of Utah.
