The mission of the Live Cell Imaging Core Facility  is to provide affordable access to modern optical microscopy for researchers in both the clinical and the basic sciences.
The facility offers a variety of microscope imaging modalities including laser scanning confocal, multiphoton, spinning disk confocal, wide-field deconvolution, CFP/YFP FRET, TIRF, and single molecule imaging.
Two workstations are available for offline image processing and analysis, including volume rendering, neuron tracing, 3D measurement, and 3D particle tracking. All the microscopes are inverted and have environmental chambers for control of temperature and CO2.
