I'm a Belgian electronics engineer, living in sunny Madrid, Spain.

I graduated as an Electronics Engineer from the State University of
Ghent, Belgium in 1989; a few years later I got an additional degree in
automation from the University of Leuven, Belgium.

Interested in stereo microscopes for soldering, circuit board inspection
and fine mechanical assembly.
