I am the Managing Director of PIEZOCONCEPT, one of the leading providers of nanopositioners dedicated to applications such as Super Resolution Microscopy, Optical Trapping and Atomic Force Microscopy. Our customers include many leading scientists engaged in leading edge research at world class universities and institutes. We developed a range of ultra-stable nanopositionner able to meet a wide range of microscopy applications with significant advantages over the currently available nanopositionners. As one of our biggest advantages, the sensor we use has exceptionally high signal, leading to picometric stability.
