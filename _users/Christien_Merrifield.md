My first degree with in Natural Sciences at Oxford followed by a PhD in
Molecular Cell Physiology at UCL and a post-doc in the lab of Wolf
Almers at the Vollum Institute, OR, USA.

I'm currently a group leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology,
Cambridge, UK. My main interest is using TIRF microscopy to investigate
the molecular mechanisms of membrane trafficking. The particular pathway
we work on is clathrin mediated endocytosis (for recent paper see:

I will be moving to the LEBS,CNRS in Gif sur Yvette, Paris in the new
year and I would like to introduce MicroManager to the lab and wean
ourselves off of Metamorph.
