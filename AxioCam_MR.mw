Because of built in delays in the AxioCam's image acquisition, there is a delay of approximately 200ms between when Micro-Manager sends the command to open the shutter and when the AxioCam's exposure begins. If over exposure of the sample is a concern, it is highly recommended that hardware triggering is used with these cameras. Refer to the below descriptions of hardware triggering to do so (All images and text below Â©2010 Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH. All rights reserved.).



'''Trigger-In'''

The exact time of exposure can be triggered from outside the camera. When the trigger-in is enabled and an acquisition function is called, the camera will delay the acquisition and wait for a trigger-in signal to be sent from an external device until it invokes the exposure.
The following graphic demonstrates the two camera models' reaction to the trigger signal when performing a triggered acquisition. An acquisition request is sent out at each '''T''', the acquisition takes place at an '''A''':

NOTE: The trigger OUT of the AxioCam HR / MR expects a TTL signal.
