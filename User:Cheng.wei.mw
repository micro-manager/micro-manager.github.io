I am a test engineer at Delphi Shanghai Test Lab. Currently I am using PI Piezo actuators to develop fatigue test equipment to test electrical connectors.
My daily work deals with vibration tests specifications and electromechanical shakers, Finite Element Analysis and Modal Test. I believe that it is we test engineers that filled the gap between real world and theoretical models.
