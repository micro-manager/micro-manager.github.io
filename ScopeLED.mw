This adapter supports two devices: DiConBrightfieldIlluminator for the brightfield illuminator, and DiConFluorescenceIlluminator for the fluorescence illuminator. 

Both devices are implemented as shutters, and both devices communicate via USB. 

'''This device adapter requires the DiCon USB Communication Adapter, which is available for free upon request at info AT diconlighting DOT com.'''
