The Pixel Calibrator Plugin measures pixel size automatically. It systematically moves the XY stage and measures the number of pixels by which the specimen is translated in X and Y. To use the Pixel Calibrator, you will need a camera, a pre-calibrated, motorized stage, and a nonperiodic specimen with reasonably high contrast. 

Usage instructions:
# Adjust your sample and microscope settings until you can Snap a high-contrast image. Make sure your specimen has lots of detail in the middle of the field of view.
# Choose Plugins > Pixel Calibrator and press Start.
# The yellow rectangle indicates the part of the image that is being followed as the stage moves.
# If calibration succeeds, the plugin will ask if you wish to add or update a Calibration setting.
# Switch to a new magnification (objective/optovar) and repeat.
