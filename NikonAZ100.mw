This adapter communicates to the AZ100 through its own driver.  On Windows, you will need to install the driver (in the 'drivers' directory in your MicroManager1.2 directory), on the Mac and Linux you will not have to do anything.  On Windows, you will likely replace the driver supplied by Nikon (and the Nikon supplied application will not work anymore).  Don't worry, you can always re-install the Nikon supplied driver (don't loose it!).

When running the Hardware Config Wizard with the AZ100 connected to the PC (and the correct driver installed), the Nikon AZ100 should appear on the COM ports page (page 2 of the wizard).  Selected this port.  Then add the AZ100Hub, Nosepiece (which is read-only, i.e. it is not motorized only encoded), Focus and Zoom.  Add the NikonAZ100 port as a pre-initialization property to the AZ100Hub, and you should be set to go.  

If provide magnification information to the system for each of your objectives, (http://micro-manager.org/documentation.php?object=NewGuide) MicroManager will automatically calculate the correct pixel size based on the current zoom settings (do not add the Zoom to the magnification information).

Note that to the AZ100 has two modes: 'mouse' control, and computer control.  To switch to computer control mode, the Focus drive will re-initialize which causes it to go all the way to the top and back down where it was.  Currently, there is nothing that can be done about this.
