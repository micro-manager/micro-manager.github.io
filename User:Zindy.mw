I am a Senior Experimental Officer in Bioimaging at the Faculty of Life Sciences in the University of Manchester, U.K.

Many of our microscopes run micro-manager and I wrote a couple of device adapters and scripts which I would like to contribute back.

At the moment, my work with micro-manager is accessible through my github repository.
