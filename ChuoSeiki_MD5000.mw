The MD5000 series controllers use a virtual serial port via the USB interface. It requires to install the USB driver before using. You can also install the MD51_52OPTOOL to set some parameters that can not be changed in Micro-Manager (such as: customized acceleration time, motor current, sensor setting, home search setting, etc.).

'''Note on Axis name'''

The "ChuoSeiki XY Controller||XY stages" support only the 2-axis controller (MD5230D). In this device adapter, the 2 stages names are defined as "X" and "Y", respectively. And it uses some functions that only support MD5230D controller.

The "ChuoSeiki Z Controller||Z stage" support both the 1-axis controller (MD5130D) and 2-axis controller (MD5230D). The axis name can be defined in the device adapter. For MD5130D, the axis name must be defined as "X". For MD5230D, the axis name can be defined as "X" or "Y", depends on which channel is connected to the Z-stage.

'''Note on Acceleration pattern'''

In Device adapter, the Acceleration pattern (include acceleration and deceleration times) can be changed from "1", "2", "3" and "4". They correspond to the 4 acceleration times that are registered in speed setting 1,2,3 and 4, respectively. To change the acceleration time to a custom value, please use MD51_52OPTOOL software.

Default Acceleration pattern:
<table>
<tr><td>Pattern  </td><td>Acceleration time  </td><td>Deceleration time  </td></tr>
<tr><td>  "1"    </td><td> 0 ms            </td><td> 0 ms            </td></tr>
<tr><td>  "2"    </td><td> 500 ms          </td><td> 0 ms            </td></tr>
<tr><td>  "3"    </td><td> 500 ms          </td><td> 0 ms            </td></tr>
<tr><td>  "4"    </td><td> 500 ms          </td><td> 0 ms            </td></tr>
</table>

'''Note on Step resolution'''

The Step resolution can be initialized to the controller using MD51_52OPTOOL. (Default step resolution registered in MD51_52OPTOOL is 20um).

For example, your step resolution is 2um, and you registered 2um in the MD51_52OPTOOL. Then in the device adapter please set step resolution = 1.
If you registered 1um in the MD51_52OPTOOL. Then in the device adapter please set step resolution = 2.
