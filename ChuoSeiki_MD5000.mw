The MD5000 series controllers use a virtual serial port via the USB interface. It requires to install the USB driver before using. You can also install the MD51_52OPTOOL to set some parameters that can not be changed in Micro-Manager (such as customized acceleration time, motor current, sensor settings, home search settings, etc.).

Please click here [https://micro-manager.org/wiki/File:MD5000USBdriver.zip] to download the MD5000 USB driver and here [https://micro-manager.org/wiki/File:MD51_52OPTOOL.zip] for the software.

To download the MD5000 user manual, please follow this link [http://www.novaelec.co.jp/eng/down/file/md515230de.pdf]

The MD5000 series Serial port settings are as following:

'''Serial port settings'''
{| class="wikitable"
|Baudrate            ||115200 ||bps
|-
|DataBits            ||8      ||bits
|-
|StopBits            ||1      ||bit
|-
|ParityBits          ||None   ||bit
|-
|AnswerTimeout       ||500    ||ms
|-
|DelayBetweenCharsMs ||0.00   ||ms
|-
|Handshaking         ||OFF    ||
|}

'''Device Adapter Initilization'''

The "ChuoSeiki XY Controller||XY stages" asks to register the Serial port and Serial port setting.

The "ChuoSeiki Z Controller||Z stages" asks to register the Serial port, Serial port setting, and Axis name.

{|  class="wikitable"
!Default Stage Settings||  ||
|-
|Speed               ||1000 ||pps
|-
|StepSize            ||1    ||um    
|-
|Acceleration pattern|| "1" ||(500 ms)
|}


Please revised stage setting using Group and Preset in Micro-Manager. The setting can be saved in a .cfg file.

{{Note|'''Axis Name Registration'''}}

The "ChuoSeiki XY Controller||XY stages" support only the 2-axis controller (MD5230D). In this device adapter, the 2 stages names are defined as "X" and "Y", respectively. And it uses some functions that only support MD5230D controller.

The "ChuoSeiki Z Controller||Z stage" support both the 1-axis controller (MD5130D) and 2-axis controller (MD5230D). The axis name can be defined in the device adapter. For MD5130D, the axis name must be defined as "X". For MD5230D, the axis name can be defined as "X" or "Y", depends on which channel is connected to the Z-stage.

{{Note|'''Acceleration Pattern'''}}

In Device adapter, the Acceleration pattern (include acceleration and deceleration times) can be changed from "1", "2", "3" and "4". They correspond to the 4 acceleration times that are registered in Controller speed settings 1,2,3 and 4, respectively. To use a customized acceleration time, please change and register using MD51_52OPTOOL software.

Default Acceleration pattern:
{|  class="wikitable"
|Pattern  ||Acceleration time   || Deceleration time 
|-
|| "1"    || 0 (ms)             ||0 (ms)
|-
|| "2"    || 500 (ms)           || 0 (ms)
|-
||  "3"   || 500 (ms)           || 0 (ms) 
|-
||  "4"   || 500 (ms)           || 0 (ms)
|}

{{Note|'''Step Resolution'''}}

The Step resolution (step zise) can be initialized to the controller using MD51_52OPTOOL. (Default step resolution registered in MD51_52OPTOOL is 20um).

<tr>For example, in case of your step resolution is 2um:</tr>
<tr>- If you registered 2um in the MD51_52OPTOOL, then please set step resolution = 1 in the device adapter.</tr>
<tr>- If you registered 1um in the MD51_52OPTOOL, then please set step resolution = 2 in the device adapter.</tr>
