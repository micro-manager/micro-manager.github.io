== Device Configuration ==

=== Wheel speed ===

95% of the time speed <code>#1</code> works best (<code>#0</code> being the fastest, which only works with an empty wheel). If speed <code>#1</code> does not work you can try the slowest (speed <code>#7</code> IIRC).  Best practice is to [[Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide#Startup_Presets|set the desired wheel speed during startup]], i.e. in your <code>Startup</code> Preset of the <code>System</code> Group.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Wheel re-homing during imaging ===

One should just optimize the filter speed setting if you ever encounter the dreaded re-homing sound due to the wheel failing to move to a filter position during Multi-Dimensional Acquisition. The wheel itself has a resonance frequency associated with the load of filters. Practically one finds the ideal speed by empirically checking which speed introduces the least vibration.
