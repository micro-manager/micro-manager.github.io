== Driver Installation (for non-Andor computers) ==

NOTE: Andor completes the steps below in their factory.
If you are setting up an Andor laser combiner on a new computer, only then do you need to follow this document.

The tested platform for installing the Andor laser launch driver is Windows XP Professional 32-bit.
It may be possible to use Windows 7 32-bit, but using it at the moment is beyond the scope of this document.

Specific driver versions are required.
Since the manufacturer websites offer later versions of these drivers, please instead use your Andor iQ CD-ROM and install only in the following order.

When you start Windows XP, ignore the Found New Hardware Wizard.
Also when installing, ignore the driver requests to restart your computer.

* Dongle Driver

* Andor iQ 1.10.2
** iQ installs the driver to recognize the DeVaSys microcontroller in the combiner.
** It would also serve as to test that communication and control of the combiner is possible.

* Measurement Computing DAC card driver
** Recognizes the Andor Precision Control Unit (PCU) box which controls the laser combiner Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter (AOTF).

* Prolific USB to RS232 driver

* Restart your PC

* Let Windows Found New Hardware wizard finish for all hardware

* Start menu > Measurement Computing > InstalCal, to register the PCU DAC card
** Running InstaCal creates a new configuration file which is used by iQ
** Simply running the program once and closing it creates the file
** Do not delete the DEMO board.
** Two boards should exist, the DEMO board #0 and your installed board #1

* Start Menu > Andor Bioimaging > ConfigurationManager
** Create a new configuration with a Kinetic Dummy Camera and the Andor laser combiner

* Remap the USB-to-Serial COM ports in your Device Manager to 201-204
** iQ reserves these specific port numbers for the combiner
** See screenshots below

* Now start iQ with your new laser combiner configuration and test

* Get the latest nightly build to run the Andor laser combiner in uManager
