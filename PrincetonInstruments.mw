== Installation ==

This adapter will work with Princeton Instrument (PI) cameras that work with PVCAM.  Be aware that you will need to install the [http://www.princetoninstruments.com/support/software.aspx PI version for PVCAM]. If you had previously installed the Photometrics version of PVCAM, then you need to manually complete de-installation using the following instructions: [[Image:PhotometricsUninstall.zip]]

If you encounter the following error message on startup:
''Error code: 39<br>''
''Line 14: Property,Core,Initialize,1<br>''
''Error code: 22<br>''
''Device Undefined. Duplicate property names are not allowed.<br>''
then Micro-Manager was most likely not terminated in a graceful way during the previous session.  Simply quit Micro-Manager, reboot your camera (by switching it off and back on again) and try again.
