* Fresh install of Micro-Manager into default root <code>C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager 1.4\</code> directory (all older root directories of Micro-Manager installations were deleted).
* Did not restart computer after MM installation.
* <code>Tools > Hardware Configuration Wizard (HCW)</code> now shows the Mosaic3 under "Available Devices".  This is noteworthy because in earlier versions of MM, the device would show up as "unavailable" until the DLLs were copied over.
* Trying to add the device gives "Error in device Mosaic3: No Mosaic3 devices found."  Of course, none of the Mosaic3 DLLs are present in the root directory yet since they are not yet bundled with the nightly build.
* Installed Mosaic SDK 3.4.17.1 from http://my.andor.com/ from <code>Software > Drivers and 3rd Party > Andor Mosaic 3 SDK</code>.  Selected option to repair MSVC++ 2010 installation when prompted by installer.  Chose not to restart.  Installed into default root folder <code>C:\Program Files\Andor Mosaic 3 SDK\</code>.
* Copied .sdk\*.dll files from root SDK directory to root MM directory:
** atcore.dll
** atdevmosaic3.dll
** Mosaic3ApiSharedMfc.dll
** Mosaic3SDKWrapper.dll
* Closed HCW.  Reopening HCW crashes MM.  Crash log points to camera DLL.  Pastebin of hs_err_pid3004.log: https://dpaste.de/WH3n/raw  Will retry HCW only with Mosaic3 and without adding camera this time.
* Now Mosaic 3 adds successfully with Mosaic3 DLLs copied to MM root directory.
* MM crashes when initializing configuration due to camera.  Version of bundled atmcd64d.dll is 2.95.30003.0.  Replaced file with version 2.96.30004.0 from Andor Driver Pack 2 - fixed.
* Confirmed all 4 DLL files are required for Mosaic3 to initialize (renaming any of them adding by adding .bak file extension raises the same initialization "Error in device Mosaic3: No Mosaic3 devices found." as seen before in HCW).
