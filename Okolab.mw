== Compatible devices ==

Any Okolab device.

== Installation ==

Connect the port named USB on the rear of the Unit to the PC USB port, using a standard mini-USB cable. Please consider that you may need an USB Male-to Male cable, depending on the hardware revision of your control unit.

{{Important|If you have more than one controller, please make sure to plug the USB cable to the unit which is directly connected to the Oko-Touch.
When two (or more) units are connected in a stack, one becomes the master and the other is acting as a "slave device", so only the controller connected to the Oko-Touch will answer to USB commands}}

== Configuration ==

# Open the ''Hardware Configuration Wizard'' from the ''Tools'' menu.
# Select desired configuration (new or existing) and  press the bottom-right ''Next'' button.
# Add ''Okolab'' device to the current configuration double-clicking on it or clicking the ''Add'' button when selected.
# Select the right COM Port or select Auto and press OK.

{{Note|Okolab devices can be found in the ''Okolab'' node if ''Available Devices'' list is ordered by vendor or in the ''Generic Device'' node if list is ordered by type.}}

== Usage ==
=== Properties ===

For every Device added to the Configuration, some managed properties are shown in the ''Device/Property Browser'' list (''Tools'' menu). Okolab devices properties are listed only if ''Show other devices'' checkbox is enabled.
Any writeable property is listed as a white row and can be changed clicking on it and then clicking enter (eg. ''H301-T Unit-BL Set Point'').

=== Live mode ===

If live is enabled, any value acquired from Okolab devices is automatically refreshed in the ''Metadata'' tab.

To use this adapter, you must manually install OKO-Control Server software which can be downloaded [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29705430/OCS/last/OKO-Control%20Server.zip here].
The installation is straightforward, default settings can be used.

=== Configuration ===

# Open the ''Hardware Configuration Wizard'' from the ''Tools'' menu.
# Select desired configuration (new or existing) and  press the bottom-right ''Next'' button.
# Add ''OKO Control Server'' device to the current configuration double-clicking on it or clicking the ''Add'' button when selected.
# Check the right COM Port number, opening ''Windows Control Panel'' and choosing first ''System'' then ''Device Manager'' then ''Ports (COM & LPT)''. There should be an entry like ''USB serial Port (COMX)'', where X is the COM Port number assigned. A good way to double-check is to remove the Okolab USB cable from the PC, as this Port should not be listed anymore. 
# Add the needed Okolab devices to the Micro-Manager configuration, writing the whole COM string into Value field of Property COM Port (eg. ''COM1'').
