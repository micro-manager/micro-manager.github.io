== Compatible devices ==

Any Okolab device.

== Installation ==

Connect the port named USB on the rear of the Unit to the PC USB port, using a standard mini-USB cable. Please consider that you may need an USB Male-to Male cable, depending on the hardware revision of your control unit.

{{Important|If you have more than one controller, please make sure to plug the USB cable to the unit which is directly connected to the Oko-Touch.
When two (or more) units are connected in a stack, one becomes the master and the other is acting as a "slave device", so only the controller connected to the Oko-Touch will answer to USB commands}}

== Configuration ==

# Open the ''Hardware Configuration Wizard'' from the ''Tools'' menu.
# Select desired configuration (new or existing) and  press the bottom-right ''Next'' button.
# Add ''Okolab'' device to the current configuration double-clicking on it or clicking the ''Add'' button when selected.
# Select the right COM Port or select Auto and press OK.

{{Note|Okolab devices can be found in the ''Okolab'' node if ''Available Devices'' list is ordered by vendor or in the ''Generic Device'' node if list is ordered by type.}}

=== Properties ===
