The code for this adapter was written by Karl Hoover. Notes: You'll need
to install the optional Twain software that comes with your camera. In
this process, you'll also need to install TWAINDSM.DLL, which is the
Twain data source manager. The latest version of the DSM is available at
Sourceforge: [2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/twain-dsm/files/) As of
1.3.41b, if the library is not correctly installed, the hardware
configuration wizard will show you the following message upon selecting
the Twain camera device:

Also please double check that the camera has a 'controllable' UI. Use
twain.org's "Twain2 Sample App" program select your camera, press
"Connect to Data Source" Your camera must report CAP\_UICONTROLLABLE =
true.
