## Installation

The camera will (we hope!) work out of the box if the driver is installed (either
by the [Device Driver
installer](https://www.theimagingsource.com/support/downloads-for-windows/) or
the [IC Capture
software](https://www.theimagingsource.com/products/software/end-user-software/).



### Snap error "Camera is not initialized"

Once you go through the Hardware configuration wizard and successfully
create a configuration file using the TIS camera, you may encounter the
problem that µManager reports "Camera is not initialized" when you press
the "Snap" button. When that happens, go to the Device/Property Browser
(under the Tools menu), select "Click here for device selection dialog"
next to the "Name" property, and then select the camera on the dialog
that appears. Restart µManager if necessary, and hopefully the camera
now works.

## Appendix

### Installation on Micro-Manager 1.4.14 and earlier

1.  Install the IC Capture software that comes with the camera and
    verify you can capture images. This will install a camera device
    driver, which the rest of the software uses to control the camera.
    You might need to first uninstall any old versions of this software.
    (You can download IC Capture and/or device drivers from
    [TIS](http://www.theimagingsource.com/en_US/support/downloads/)).
2.  Install the IC Imaging Control SDK, version 3.2 (download from
    [TIS](http://www.theimagingsource.com/en_US/support/downloads/)).
    Micro-Manager 1.4.14 and current nightly builds (as of Aug, 2013)
    require version 3.2.
3.  During the installation, make sure to explicitly check "Visual C++
    2008" when you are presented with a page to select the components to
    install.
4.  Copy the following files, found in either
    *<your home folder>*\\Documents\\IC Imaging
    Control\\3.2\\classlib\\win32\\release or
    *<your home folder>*\\Documents\\IC Imaging
    Control\\3.2\\classlib\\x64\\release, to the Micro-Manager-1.4
    folder. The following names are hard-coded, and if you have anything
    with a different name, it is not going to work (renaming a different
    DLL to match will not work, either, of course).
    -   If you are using 32-bit Micro-Manager (even if Windows is
        64-bit): **TIS\_UDSHL09\_vc9.dll** (which in turn requires
        **TIS\_DShowLib09.dll**)
    -   If you are using 64-bit Micro-Manager:
        **TIS\_UDSHL09\_vc9\_x64.dll** (which in turn requires
        **TIS\_DShowLib09\_x64.dll**)

### Issues with USB 3.0 cameras

Early 2018, people reported that USB 3.0 cameras did not work.  Apparently, 
TIS had not yet updated their drivers.  Currently (2022), USB 3.0 cameras 
work fine after installation of the TIS drivers.  There does seem to be an 
incompatibility with drivers installed by Nikon Elements (Nikon includes a TIS
camera in some of their systems).   It is not yet clear to me (Nico) if installing
the TIS drivers after Nikon installs their drivers works with both MM and Elements.
