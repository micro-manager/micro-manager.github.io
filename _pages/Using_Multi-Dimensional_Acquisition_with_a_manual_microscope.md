title: Using Multi-Dimensional Acquisition with a manual microscope
layout: page
---

If you do not have a motorized dichroic turret or filter wheel and need
to switch filters between taking images in Micro-Manager, you can still
use the Multi-Dimensional Acquisition and its facilities. To do so,

-   Make a [hardware
    configuration](Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide "wikilink") that
    includes the DemoCamera-Dichroic device (or any other demo state
    device).
-   Make a [Channel
    Configuration](Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide#configuration-presets "wikilink")
    group that represents the filters/dichroics that you have and name
    them accordingly.
-   Start the Script Panel (under the Tools menu). Click the top-left
    "Add" button, and navigate to the "scripts" folder in the
    Micro-Manager directory. Select the script "ManualAcq2.bsh" (you
    need to do this step only one time, the Script Panel will remember
    the scripts you loaded). Run the ManualAcq2.bsh script by pressing
    the Run button in the top or by double clicking the text
    "ManualAcq2.bsh" in the left-hand pane.
-   Set up an MDA (using the Multi-D Acq. button and ensuing window) and
    select the desired channels.
-   When you run the acquisition, you will be prompted to put the
    correct filters/dichroics in place.
