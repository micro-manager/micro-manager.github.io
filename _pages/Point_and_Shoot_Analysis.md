## Point and Shoot Analysis plugin

This plugin was made to analyze data acquired using the [Projector](Projector_Plugin)
plugin, specifically data acquired in the "Point and Shoot" mode of this
plugin. To do so, start an MDA with a "live" time-lapse (i.e. 0 interval
between time points), and bleach objects as you please. Bleach positions
and time points are stored in a file in the "Log Directory". Copy this
file to a safe place to be used in this analysis plugin.
