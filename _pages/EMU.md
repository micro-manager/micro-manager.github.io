Easier Micro-manager User interface (EMU) loads reconfigurable user
interfaces in Micro-manager. This page describes the basics of EMU,
refer to the [user
guide](https://jdeschamps.github.io/EMU-guide/userguide.html) for more
details.

## Principle

In order to provide better user experience, tailored user interfaces
(UI) are often an important, albeit regularly overlooked, feature of a
microscope. In Micro-Manager, UIs can be implemented as plugins and
should modify the state of device properties whenever the user interacts
with the UI controls (buttons, sliders...etc..). Because similar devices
might have different types of properties (e.g. power percentage vs
absolute power) and states (e.g. "On" vs "1"), great efforts should be
spent to accommodate various devices. Otherwise, the interface will not
be easily transferable and shared with other groups.

EMU provides a mechanism to build flexible and reconfigurable user
interfaces. In the user point of view, EMU delivers a choice of UIs that
are rapidly ready to use thanks to an intuitive configuration menu. In
particular, the configuration menu allows mapping the device properties
to the various functions of the interface in few clicks. EMU also
simplifies the task for programmers, as implementing a new UI can be as
simple as using a drag and drop software (such as Eclipse WindowBuilder)
to create the interface and writing few lines of code for compatibility.
EMU then takes care of the configuration and all interactions with the
devices.

In summary, with EMU:

-   Users have access to a bank of UIs
-   The interfaces are rapidly configured and ready to use
-   The UIs are easily be transferred between similar set-ups
-   New UIs can be designed with drag and drop softwares and few extra
    lines of code

In the future, we hope to increase the number of available EMU plugins
thanks to community contributions.

## Using EMU

User interfaces will now be referred as **plugins** for EMU. Each plugin
consists of several modules called configurable panels. Upon loading a
plugin, EMU aggregates the properties and parameters of each module and
provides the user with an intuitive interface to configure them.

### First start

Upon starting EMU for the first time, the user must choose a plugin to
load:

<figure>
<img src="media/Emu-plugin-selection.png" title="media/Emu-plugin-selection.png" width="200" alt="media/Emu-plugin-selection.png" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">media/Emu-plugin-selection.png</figcaption>
</figure>

After validating the choice, the plugin is loaded. Since no
configuration exists yet, EMU also automatically starts the
**configuration wizard**.

### Plugin configuration

Plugins are configured using the **configuration wizard**, which is
accessible through the configuration menu by clicking on **modify
configuration**:

<figure>
<img src="media/Emu-configuration-menu.PNG" title="media/Emu-configuration-menu.PNG" width="150" alt="media/Emu-configuration-menu.PNG" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">media/Emu-configuration-menu.PNG</figcaption>
</figure>

The **configuration wizard** allows changing aspects of the interface
and mapping Micro-manager device properties to UI properties. On the
upper part of the wizard's window, the user can set the name of the
configuration and show/hide the **help** window.

In addition, it features four tabs:

-   Plugin settings
-   Properties
-   Parameters
-   Global settings

Note that changing the name of an existing configuration will create a
new configuration without deleting the old one. Use the **configuration
manager** to delete existing configurations.

One the plugin configured, click on **save** to write the configuration
to disk. The configuration can be found in the Micro-manager
installation folder, under **/EMU/config.uicfg**.

#### Plugin settings

<figure>
<img src="media/Emu-configuration-plugin.PNG" title="media/Emu-configuration-plugin.PNG" width="300" alt="media/Emu-configuration-plugin.PNG" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">media/Emu-configuration-plugin.PNG</figcaption>
</figure>

Plugin settings are intended to be general options of the interface.
They can for instance be used to hide/show some modules, to set the
number of modules or simply give them a name.

Note that in this example, the SimpleUI plugin has a single plugin
setting. htSMLM (see third-party plugins) has many more.

#### Properties

<figure>
<img src="media/Emu-configuration-properties.PNG" title="media/Emu-configuration-properties.PNG" width="300" alt="media/Emu-configuration-properties.PNG" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">media/Emu-configuration-properties.PNG</figcaption>
</figure>

The property tab is aimed at pairing Micro-Manager device properties
with UI properties. For each relevant UI property (1st column), select a
device in the device list (2nd column) then the corresponding device
property (3rd list).

Some UI properties require state values. For instance, some UI
properties are linked to a toggle button (button with on and off states)
and therefore require two state values. Use the device property browser
(Micro-Manager menus) to read out the correct values and enter them for
each state (see on the previous image the states for the filterwheel
position). Note that configuration preset groups can also be allocated
to a UI property.

There are then different types of UI property:

-   Without states
-   Single-state, with only one state
-   Two-state, with On and Off state
-   Multi-state, with N states
-   Rescaled property, see **example 2**

Once the UI property is allocated, the state values have to be set to a
value allowed by the device property. If the UI property is not
allocated, then these will be ignored.

**Example 1:** In the above screenshot, the filter wheel has multiple
states (N=6). If your filter wheel has four positions numbered from 0 to
3, then the set the first four UI property states to 0, 1, 2 and 3. Then
set the remaining ones to one of these values.

**Example 2:** Rescaled properties do not have states but two
parameters: slope and offset. When the user enter a *value* for the
property in the UI, the value is scaled to *slope\*value+offset* before
being applied to the device property. A good example use for such a
property is with laser percentages. Some lasers only have a power (mW)
device property in Micro-Manager, while the controls of the UI might be
intended for percentages. Then, setting *slope=max\_power/100* and
*offset=0* allows the user to use percentage with the UI, while
modifying the device property with the absolute laser power.

#### Parameters

<figure>
<img src="media/Emu-configuration-parameters.PNG" title="media/Emu-configuration-parameters.PNG" width="300" alt="media/Emu-configuration-parameters.PNG" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">media/Emu-configuration-parameters.PNG</figcaption>
</figure>

Parameters are mostly intended to provide reconfigurable aspects of the
UI, whether they are aesthetic (e.g.: colors), functional (e.g.:
hide/show or enable/disable buttons) or for improved user-friendliness
(e.g.: titles or button texts).

#### Global settings

<figure>
<img src="media/Emu-configuration-global.PNG" title="media/Emu-configuration-global.PNG" width="300" alt="media/Emu-configuration-global.PNG" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">media/Emu-configuration-global.PNG</figcaption>
</figure>

Global settings are EMU options. For the moment, there is only a single
setting:

-   **Enable unallocated warnings**: when checked, it warns the user
    that some UI properties have not been allocated.

Note that global settings are set for all configurations.

#### Help

Upon clicking on the **help** button, the help window pops up:

<figure>
<img src="media/Emu-configuration-help.PNG" title="media/Emu-configuration-help.PNG" width="300" alt="media/Emu-configuration-help.PNG" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">media/Emu-configuration-help.PNG</figcaption>
</figure>

This window is updated every time the user clicks on a row in one of the
configuration wizard tabs. The help window provides a description of the
currently selected setting/property/parameter or property state.

### Manage configurations

The **configuration manager** can be found by clicking on the
*Configuration* menu, then on *manage configurations*.

<figure>
<img src="media/Emu-configuration-menu.PNG" title="media/Emu-configuration-menu.PNG" width="150" alt="media/Emu-configuration-menu.PNG" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">media/Emu-configuration-menu.PNG</figcaption>
</figure>

Configuration manager:

<figure>
<img src="media/Emu-configuration-manager.PNG" title="media/Emu-configuration-manager.PNG" width="300" alt="media/Emu-configuration-manager.PNG" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">media/Emu-configuration-manager.PNG</figcaption>
</figure>

It allows deleting existing configurations. Note that the currently
loaded configuration cannot be deleted.

### Switch configuration

When multiple configurations related to the currently loaded plugin
exist, then the user can switch between these configurations using the
*switch plugin* menu:

<figure>
<img src="media/Emu-switch-config.png" title="media/Emu-switch-config.png" width="250" alt="media/Emu-switch-config.png" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">media/Emu-switch-config.png</figcaption>
</figure>

**Example:** If a set-up has two laser combiners, different
configurations can map each combiner with the laser controls.

### Switch plugin

In the same way as for configurations, the user can switch between
plugins:

<figure>
<img src="media/Emu-switch-plugin.png" title="media/Emu-switch-plugin.png" width="250" alt="media/Emu-switch-plugin.png" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">media/Emu-switch-plugin.png</figcaption>
</figure>

### Plugin menu

The plugin menu has two entries:

<figure>
<img src="media/Emu-plugin-menu.png" title="media/Emu-plugin-menu.png" width="100" alt="media/Emu-plugin-menu.png" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">media/Emu-plugin-menu.png</figcaption>
</figure>

**Refresh UI** query all current property states and updates the
controls of the UI (e.g.: buttons, text boxes, sliders...) to reflect
the new states. If a device property is modified outside the plugin then
the state of the UI will not be in sync anymore. This happens for
instance by interacting with the device property browser or
configuration preset groups (main Micro-manager window). Using **Refresh
UI** will sync the UI back with the device property states.

**Description** shows the description of all modules (panels) of the
plugins.

## Plugins

Compiled plugins (.jar files) can be placed in your Micro-Manager
installation folder, in the /EMU/ folder. They should then be
automatically discovered by EMU and either loaded upon the first start
or using the *switch plugins* menu.

### Current plugins

Currently, two plugins are distributed with EMU: SimpleUI and
iBeamSmart.

#### SimpleUI

SimpleUI is a simple interface controlling four lasers and an optional
filter wheel.

<figure>
<img src="media/Emu-simpleui.PNG" title="media/Emu-simpleui.PNG" width="300" alt="media/Emu-simpleui.PNG" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">media/Emu-simpleui.PNG</figcaption>
</figure>

All laser/filter names and colors are configurable parameters.

#### iBeamSmart

iBeamSmart provides an interface for multiple [iBeamSmart
lasers](https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Toptica_iBeamSmartCW) from
Toptica. Each module (= laser) features in particular controls for the
FINE settings and for external digital triggering. Both of these
features can be hidden using the corresponding parameters.

</figure>

### Third-party plugins

-   [htSMLM](https://github.com/jdeschamps/htSMLM), the Ries group SMLM
    microscope interface. It controls four lasers, multiple filter
    wheels, a z-stage and features various additional controls. It
    includes automated activation for SMLM and unsupervised imaging
    tools.
