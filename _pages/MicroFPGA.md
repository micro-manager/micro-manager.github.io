MicroFPGA is a cost-efficient electronic platform generating typical
signals used to control microscope elements. It is based on hobby
[FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) from
[Alchitry](https://alchitry.com/collections/all) (Au and Cu FPGAs).

In particular, MicroFPGA allows complex and independent triggering of
multiple lasers (us to ms pulses, on rising or falling camera trigger,
following patterned sequences), as well as controlling several
servomotors, TTL hardware (e.g. flip-mirrors, switches), reading analog
signals or producing analog voltages (with the help of a complimentary
electronics board).

In order to use MicroFPGA, you need to set-up the FPGA board and upload
the MicroFPGA firmware. For more information, refer to the [Github
repository](https://github.com/jdeschamps/MicroFPGA).

The Github repository contains:

  - [Guide and
    tutorials](https://github.com/jdeschamps/MicroFPGA/blob/master/tutorials/README.md)
  - Firmware for the
    [Au](https://github.com/jdeschamps/MicroFPGA/tree/master/Au_firmware)
    and
    [Cu](https://github.com/jdeschamps/MicroFPGA/tree/master/Cu_firmware)
    FPGA boards.
  - [Complimentary
    electronics](https://github.com/jdeschamps/MicroFPGA/tree/master/Electronics)
  - Librairies for
    [Java](https://github.com/jdeschamps/MicroFPGA/tree/master/MicroFPGA-Java)
    and
    [Python](https://github.com/jdeschamps/MicroFPGA/tree/master/MicroFPGA-Py)

{% include notice icon="info" content="For use with Micro-Manager 1.4, the baudrate must be changed within the firmware ([https://github.com/jdeschamps/MicroFPGA/blob/master/tutorials/changing_baudrate.md see tutorial]) as the default value is bigger than what the Micro-manager Hardware Wizard Configuration menu allows." %}
