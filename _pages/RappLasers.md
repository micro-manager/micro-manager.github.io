------------------------------------------------------------------------

The RappLasers device adapter controls Rapp laser controllers, providing
shutter control, light output control, and intensity adjustment for Rapp
laser systems. For convencience, the laser are implemented as shutters.  The shutter will only work in Software control mode and will control the "Light" (laser on/off) rather than the "Shutter".

## Properties

| Property      | Description                                                                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Port          | Serial COM port for communication with the laser controller                                      |
| Shutter       | Controls the hardware shutter (Open/Closed).  This is more of a safety shutter that is not meant to be switched fast and often.                                                      |
| Light         | Controls the software laser output (On/Off)                                                      |
| Intensity (%) | Sets the laser power from 0-100%                                                                 |
| ControlMode   | Selects the control mode: Software, External-Mix, External-Digital, RMI-Mix, RMI-Digital, External-Analog, or RMI-Analog |
| SerialNumber  | Read-only device serial number                                                                   |
| LaserName     | Read-only device model identifier                                                                |

## Control Modes

The laser supports multiple control modes:

- **Software** (default): Laser is controlled entirely through software commands
- **External-Mix**: Mixed external control
- **External-Digital**: Digital external triggering
- **RMI-Mix**: Mixed RMI control
- **RMI-Digital**: Digital RMI control
- **External-Analog**: Analog external control
- **RMI-Analog**: Analog RMI control

External refers to BNC connectors on the controller, RMI to another type of connector (first time I have heard of these, and I can not find them with a few searches, so maybe something Rapp specific).

## Installation

Configure the laser controller in the Hardware Configuration Wizard by
selecting "RappLasers" from the device list and specifying the appropriate
COM port. Standard (default) serial port settings will work.

## Normal Usage
Most often, these lasers will be used in conjunction with the Rapp UGA-42 device for photo-bleaching/photo-activation.  In that case, make sure to open the shutter, and set the ControMode to RMI-Mix.  This is most conveniently done in the System-Startup configuration.  Please note that in RMI-Mix (or External-Mix) modes the Light and Intensity controls will not work (they are replaces by the external inputs).
