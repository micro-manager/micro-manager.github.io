You can use Matlab to run and control the Micro-Manager gui and core.
Here's how (examples shown using version 1.4.11; use the most recent
version you have installed):

1\. In Matlab, type

```
>> edit classpath.txt
```

and add the following lines, adjusting the path if necessary:

```
C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.4.11/ij.jar
C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.4.11/plugins/Micro-Manager/MMCoreJ.jar
C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.4.11/plugins/Micro-Manager/MMJ_.jar
C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.4.11/plugins/Micro-Manager/bsh-2.0b4.jar
C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.4.11/plugins/Micro-Manager/swingx-0.9.5.jar
C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.4.11/plugins/Micro-Manager/swing-layout-1.0.4.jar
```

you will need the additional items below in the classpath.txt to use the
multi-image file format:

```
C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.4.11/plugins/Micro-Manager/ome-xml.jar
C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.4.11/plugins/Micro-Manager/loci-common.jar
C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.4.11/plugins/Micro-Manager/scifio.jar
C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.4.11/plugins/Micro-Manager/slf4j-api-1.7.1.jar
```

2\. Again in Matlab, type

```
>> edit librarypath.txt
```

and add the line:

```
C:/Program Files/Micro-Manager-1.4
```

3\. Restart Matlab. Now type the following at the command prompt:

```
>> cd 'c:/program files/Micro-Manager-1.4'
>> import org.micromanager.MMStudio;
>> gui = MMStudio(false);
>> gui.show;
>> mmc = gui.getCore;
>> acq = gui.getAcquisitionEngine;
```

Now you have
[gui](https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc/mmstudio/org/micromanager/api/ScriptInterface.html),
[mmc](https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc/mmcorej/mmcorej/CMMCore.html),
and
[acq](http://micro-manager.org/content/doc/mmstudio/org/micromanager/api/AcquisitionEngine.html)
objects that you can control from Matlab, very similar to how you would
in [Beanshell scripts](Example_Beanshell_scripts "wikilink").

On Mac OS X, current versions of Matlab have a bug that causes
Micro-Manager to fail on startup. To work around this bug, issue the
following command before starting the Micro-Manager GUI:

&gt;&gt;
java.lang.System.clearProperty('java.util.prefs.PreferencesFactory')

(Reported by Paul Andrews, work around suggested by The Mathworks
support).
