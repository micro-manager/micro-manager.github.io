The Projector plugin provides a single graphical user interface for
controlling SLMs (spatial light modulators), such as DMDs (digital
mirror devices), LCOS (liquid crystal on silicon) modulators or even
digital computer projectors, and also for controlling steerable-mirror
(e.g. galvo-based) phototargeting devices, including the [Rapp
UGA-40](Rapp "wikilink"), the [Andor MicroPoint](MicroPoint "wikilink"),
and the [ASI scanner](ASITiger "wikilink").

The Projector plugin's interface shows three tabs: Point and Shoot,
ROIs, and Setup. How to operate each tab is described in detail below.

## Setup tab

![Plugin\media/_projector-setup.png](media/Plugin_projector-setup.png
"media/Plugin_projector-setup.png")

The Setup tab allows you to test the phototargeting device and perform
initial calibration. Press On and Off buttons to turn the light on and
off (in the case of a pulsed laser such as the MicroPoint, the On button
will only turn the light on briefly). Press the "Show center spot"
button to illuminate the center of the phototargeting device's range.
This Center Spot should be visible in the camera's field of view -- if
it isn't, the physical alignment of the camera and/or phototargeter will
need to be adjusted.

The Calibrate button starts an automated calibration procedure, where
the phototargeter's internal coordinates are mapped to the pixel
coordinates to the camera's pixel coordinates. This calibration allows
the Projector plugin to convert mouse clicks or ROIs drawn on the live
camera image into precisely directed phototargeting events.

The calibration procedure starts by illuminating a few spots near the
center of the phototargeter range. This gives the Projector plugin an
estimate of the orientation and location of the camera field of view
relative to the phototargeter range. Then, points in a square lattice
are illuminated one by one, and imaged on the camera. The Projector
plugin then uses the lattice measurements to compute a mapping of each
pixel to phototargeter coordinates for future phototargeting. Mappings
for each camera and phototargeting deviced are stored and will be
remembered even after Micro-Manager is restarted. The relative
orientation of the camera and phototargeting device does not matter;
however they should be turned roughly square with each other (0, 90,
180, or 270 degrees) so that the square lattice isn't cut off.

Obviously the calibration should be performed with the same objective
and camera that will be used for actual phototargeting. Currently there
is no way to store different calibration mappings, e.g. for two
different objectives.

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| On / Off               | Toggles calibration mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Calibrate              | Creates calibration map of phototargeting device range to the camera pixel position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Phototargeting channel | Toggles to specified channel during phototargeting. You don't need to set this unless some hardware needs to be moved during imaging, like a dichroic and/or a shutter. If you don't see your channel listed, you must set the `Core-ChannelGroup` in the `Property Browser` to the Group containing this channel. |

## Point and Shoot tab

![Plugin\_projector-point\_and\media/_shoot.png](media/Plugin_projector-point_and_shoot.png
"media/Plugin_projector-point_and_shoot.png")

Point and Shoot lets you phototarget a small region instantaneously, by
clicking on a live image of the specimen. Galvo-based devices fire a
single shot, while SLM devices will turn on in a small region around the
clicked pixel. The procedure is very simple:

1.  Under the Point and Shoot tab, set "Point and shoot mode" to "On."
2.  Turn on live mode.
3.  Hold down the Control key (on the keyboard) and click anywhere in
    the live image window. You should immediately see a laser spot
    appear for a time at the clicked location.

## ROIs tab

![Plugin\media/_projector-rois.png](media/Plugin_projector-rois.png
"media/Plugin_projector-rois.png")

The Regions of Interest (ROIs) tab lets you specify regions on the image
to be phototargeted. Phototargeting of an ROI can be carried out
instantly, or programmed into a Multi-Dimensional Acquisition.

1.  Before running an ROI experiment, the calibration (described above
    under "Setup Tab") must already have been carried out. Over time,
    the calibration may drift, so repeat calibration as needed. It's
    also useful to try "Point and Shoot" first, to make sure the
    phototargeting hardware is working and the calibration is correct.

The procedure for illuminating a single ROI is as follows:

1.  Select one of the ROI tools on the ImageJ toolbar. Possible ROIs
    tools can include Rectangular, Oval, Polygon, Freehand, or Point.
    (Note that some devices, such as the MicroPoint and ASI scanner,
    currently only support Point targeting.)
2.  Press "Set ROI(s)". The ROI will be uploaded to the phototargeting
    device.
3.  Choose a value of 1 or more for "Loop". If Loop is greater than 1,
    then for every phototargeting event, the phototargeter will loop
    through the set of ROIs multiple times.
4.  Turn on Live mode (on the main Micro-Manager window).
5.  Press "Run Rois now\!" The ROI should be illuminated (rastered in
    the case of a galvo-based device).

It's also possible to run multiple ROIs:

1.  Click the ROI Manager button to display ImageJ's ROI Manager.
2.  Draw an ROI, and press "Add." The ROI will be included in the list.
    This is further detailed in [\#Drawing Multiple ImageJ
    ROIs](#Drawing_Multiple_ImageJ_ROIs "wikilink").
3.  Press "Set ROI(s)", turn on Live mode, and then "Run Rois now\!"

Pressing "Run ROIs now\!" is a good way to phototarget the specimen
during a Multi-Dimensional Acquisition. Just start the MDA, wait for the
right moment, and then hit "Run Rois now\!" to cause phototargeting to
start, while acquisition continues simultaneously.

Alternatively, you can run ROIs at pre-determined time points in an
acquisition sequence:

1.  Check Run ROIs in Multi-Dimensional Acquisition
2.  Enter a "Start Frame" index -- that is, the first frame at which
    phototargeting should commence.
3.  If further phototargeting events are desired, check "Repeat every"
    and specify how many frames should elapse before the next
    phototargeting event should occur (after the first).

| Repeat every \_\_ frames                  | Number of frames between successive phototargeting events in an MDA. `Setup` tab.                                     |

## Drawing Multiple ImageJ ROIs

If you are not as familiar with ImageJ ROIs and have been using ROIs in
other software packages, some differences are:

1.  Only a single ROI can be drawn at a time. Drawing another ROI erases
    the current drawing, and so one must click the
    {% include Key text="Add [t]" %} button in the ROI Manager before
    drawing another ROI.
2.  To change a ROI that has already been added to the ROI Manager list:
      - Select the ROI. The easiest way to select a ROI is clicking on
        the label as explained in the [\#tips](#tips "wikilink");
        alternatively, select the entry in the ROI Manager list.
      - Reshape the ROI with the square white handles, or to change the
        type of ROI, draw the new ROI.
      - Click {% include Key text="Update" %}.

### Tips

1.  Delete all ROIs by double-clicking the {% include Key text="Delete" %}
    button.
2.  Visually select a ROI by clicking the ROI's center label number in
    the image. You will need to enable both the "Show All" and "Labels"
    checkboxs in the ROI Manager to do this.
3.  Move a ROI by dragging the ROI's center label number in the image.

## FAQ

  - Can one stop the device firing at any time?  
    Unfortunately there is no emergency "off" button at the moment.

<!-- end list -->

  - What happens when I target something outside the device range?  
    It ignores those clicks.
