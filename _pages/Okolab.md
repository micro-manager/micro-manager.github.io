## Compatible devices

Any Okolab device.
This means all control units present in our catalog list from January 2017
until current date (January 2022).

## Installation

Okolab control units have a port named USB, usually on the rear of the unit.
USB port type can be different based on the control unit: Mini-USB, Micro-USB, USB type C.
Connect the control unit USB port to the PC USB port, selecting the proper USB cable.
Windows PC should detect the device as a Virtual COM port (COMnn).
If this is not the case, Drivers can be downloaded from 
[here](https://www.oko-lab.com/public/okolib/drivers/Okolab%20Drivers%20Setup.exe).

{% include notice icon="note" content="If you have more than one controller, please
make sure to plug the USB cable to the unit which is directly connected
to the Oko-Touch. When two (or more) units are connected in a stack, one
becomes the master and the other is acting as a &apos;slave device&apos;, so only
the controller connected to the Oko-Touch will answer to USB
commands" %}

{% include notice icon="info" content="The Nightly Build version of Micro-Manager 2.0-gamma
may not install a required folder.
If, after the installation, the &apos;okolib&apos; folder is missing in your Micro-Manager
installation folder, please download the following file
[Okolib db folder](https://www.oko-lab.com/public/micro-manager-2.0/Okolib.zip) 
and un-compress it in Micro-Manager installation folder." %}

## Configuration

1.  Open the *Hardware Configuration Wizard* from the *Tools* menu.
2.  Select desired configuration (new or existing) and press the
    bottom-right *Next* button.
3.  Add *Okolab* device to the current configuration double-clicking on
    it or clicking the *Add* button when selected.
4.  Select the right COM Port or select Auto and press OK.

{% include notice icon="info" content="Okolab devices can be found in the &apos;Okolab&apos; node if &apos;Available Devices&apos; list is ordered by vendor or in the &apos;Generic Device&apos; node if list is ordered by type." %}

## Usage

### Properties

For every Device added to the Configuration, some managed properties are
shown in the *Device/Property Browser* list (*Tools* menu). Okolab
devices properties are listed only if *Show other devices* checkbox is
enabled. Any writeable property is listed as a white row and can be
changed clicking on it and then clicking enter (eg. *H301-T Unit-BL Set
Point*).

### Live mode

If live is enabled, any value acquired from Okolab devices is
automatically refreshed in the *Metadata* tab.

### Logging

To log data acquired from Okolab devices, an experiment must be started
(*Tools* -&gt; *Multi-Dimensional Acquisition*). Data are logged in the
metadata.txt file if *Separate images files* is selected or in the image
file itself if *Image stack file* is selected.

### Installation

Connect the port named USB on the rear of the Unit to the PC USB port,
using a standard mini-USB cable. Please consider that you may need an
USB Male-to Male cable, depending on the hardware revision of your
control unit.

{% include notice icon="note" content="If you have more than one controller, please
make sure to plug the USB cable to the unit which is directly connected
to the Oko-Touch. When two (or more) units are connected in a stack, one
becomes the master and the other is acting as a &apos;slave device&apos;, so only
the controller connected to the Oko-Touch will answer to USB
commands" %}

To use this adapter, you must manually install OKO-Control Server
software which can be downloaded
[here](https://www.oko-lab.com/public/OCS/OKO-Control%20Server%203.0.0.zip).
The installation is straightforward, default settings can be used.

### Configuration

1.  Open the *Hardware Configuration Wizard* from the *Tools* menu.
2.  Select desired configuration (new or existing) and press the
    bottom-right *Next* button.
3.  Add *OKO Control Server* device to the current configuration
    double-clicking on it or clicking the *Add* button when selected.
4.  Check the right COM Port number, opening *Windows Control Panel* and
    choosing first *System* then *Device Manager* then *Ports (COM &
    LPT)*. There should be an entry like *USB serial Port (COMX)*, where
    X is the COM Port number assigned. A good way to double-check is to
    remove the Okolab USB cable from the PC, as this Port should not be
    listed anymore.
5.  Add the needed Okolab devices to the Micro-Manager configuration,
    writing the whole COM string into Value field of Property COM Port
    (eg. *COM1*).
