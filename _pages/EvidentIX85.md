## Overview

Micro-Manager provides three device adapters for the Evident IX85 microscope system:

1. **EvidentIX85XYStage** - Controls the motorized XY stage (all platforms)
2. **EvidentIX85** - Controls the microscope body without SDK (all platforms, no ZDC support)
3. **EvidentIX85Win** - Controls the microscope body with SDK (Windows only, full ZDC support)

The XY stage adapter is completely independent from the microscope body adapters and can be used on any platform with standard serial communication.

## Installation

### XY Stage (All Platforms)

The EvidentIX85XYStage adapter requires only a serial connection to the stage controller. No additional software or drivers are needed.

**Serial Port Settings:**
- Baud rate: 115200
- Parity: Even
- Stop bits: 2
- Data bits: 8
- Handshaking: Off

### Microscope Body - EvidentIX85 (All Platforms)

The EvidentIX85 adapter communicates directly with the microscope through the serial port without requiring Evident SDK files. This adapter works on all platforms (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) but does not support the ZDC (Zero Drift Compensation) autofocus system.

No additional software installation is required.

### Microscope Body - EvidentIX85Win (Windows Only)

The EvidentIX85Win adapter provides full functionality including ZDC autofocus support, but requires the Evident SDK files.

**Obtaining the SDK:**

Contact Evident (formerly Olympus) to request the IX85 SDK files (IX5_SDK). The SDK is not publicly available and must be obtained directly from Evident.

**SDK Installation:**

1. Extract the SDK files to a location on your computer (e.g., `C:\Evident\IX5_SDK_v1`)
2. In the Hardware Configuration Wizard, set the "SDK_DLL_Path" property to point to the SDK DLL file (e.g., `C:\Evident\IX5_SDK_v1\IX-Library\msl_pm_ix85.dll`)

The adapter will automatically detect available COM ports when creating a configuration.

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

All Evident IX85 adapters communicate through a hub device that must be added first before adding any peripheral devices.

1. In the Hardware Configuration Wizard, add the appropriate hub:
   - **EvidentIX85Win-Hub** (Windows with SDK)
   - **EvidentIX85-Hub** (all platforms without SDK)
   - **EvidentIX85XYStage** (for XY stage only)

2. Configure the serial port for the hub device
3. Add the peripheral devices you want to control

### Objective Setup Configuration (EvidentIX85Win Only)

{% include notice icon="info" content="The ObjectiveSetup device requires a special two-step configuration process to properly configure objectives before using other microscope devices." %}

**Step 1: Configure Objectives**

1. Create a new hardware configuration
2. Add only these devices:
   - EvidentIX85Win-Hub
   - EvidentIX85Win-ObjectiveSetup
3. Save this configuration (e.g., "IX85-ObjectiveConfig.cfg")
4. Load this configuration in Micro-Manager
5. In the Device/Property Browser, configure each objective position:
   - Either select the objetcive name using the "Database-Selection property (note that you can filter using the "Filter-By-Immersion" and "Filter-By-Magnification" properties) and activate the "Send-To-SDK" property, or set the "Special-Immersion", "Special-Magnification", "Special-NA" properties and activate the "Special-Send-To-SDK" property.  These settings will be saved on disk by the SDK and be available to all applications that use the SDK.

**Step 2: Create Main Configuration**

1. Create a new hardware configuration
2. Add EvidentIX85Win-Hub
3. Add all the devices you need **except** ObjectiveSetup:
   - EvidentIX85Win-Focus
   - EvidentIX85Win-Nosepiece
   - EvidentIX85Win-Autofocus (ZDC)
   - Other peripheral devices as needed
4. Save this configuration (e.g., "IX85-Main.cfg")
5. Use this configuration for normal operation

{% include notice icon="info" content="Screenshots showing the objective configuration interface will be added in a future update." %}

## Device-Specific Notes

### ZDC Autofocus (EvidentIX85Win Only)

The EvidentIX85Win adapter provides full support for the ZDC (Zero Drift Compensation) autofocus system with three workflow modes:

**Workflow Modes:**

1. **Measure Offset** - Measures the Z-offset between current focus position and ZDC focus
2. **Find Focus with Offset** - Finds focus and applies a measured offset
3. **Continuous Focus** - Maintains continuous focus tracking

**Using ZDC:**

The ZDC system requires initialization for each objective. The adapter automatically handles this when switching objectives or when coverslip settings change.

**Offset Lens:**

The ZDC offset lens can be controlled independently as a stage device, allowing fine adjustment of the ZDC focal plane.

### Nosepiece

The nosepiece device supports:
- Objective position control
- Reading objective specifications (NA, magnification, medium, working distance)
- Parfocal positioning (maintains focus when changing objectives)
- Near limit configuration (prevents objective collision)
- Escape distance setting

### DIA Shutter

The transmitted light (DIA) shutter device controls:
- Shutter open/close state
- Brightness (0-255)
- Mechanical shutter enable/disable

When the mechanical shutter is disabled, brightness control alone is used for intensity modulation.

### Hand Switch Control (EvidentIX85Win Only)

The microscope's manual control unit (MCZ) can be configured through properties:

- **HandSwitch-FocusJog** - Enable/disable focus jog control
- **HandSwitch-Switches** - Enable/disable manual switches
- **HandSwitch-CondenserSwitch** - Enable/disable condenser turret control
- **HandSwitch-Indicators** - Control indicator lights (Normal/Dark/Disabled)


### XY Stage

The EvidentIX85XYStage adapter is independent of the microscope body adapters and can be used standalone or in combination with either EvidentIX85 or EvidentIX85Win.

The stage supports:
- XY positioning
- Origin setting
- Speed control
- Movement in micrometers or steps

## Choosing the Right Adapter

**Use EvidentIX85Win if:**
- You are on Windows
- You have access to the Evident SDK
- You need ZDC autofocus support
- You want peripheral device discovery
- You want objective setup configuration

**Use EvidentIX85 if:**
- You are on Mac OS X or Linux
- You don't have access to the Evident SDK
- You don't need ZDC autofocus
- You want cross-platform compatibility

**Use EvidentIX85XYStage for:**
- Controlling the motorized XY stage on any platform
- Can be combined with either EvidentIX85 or EvidentIX85Win

## Troubleshooting

### SDK DLL Not Found (EvidentIX85Win)

If you receive an error about the SDK DLL not being found:
1. Verify the SDK_DLL_Path property points to the correct DLL location
2. Ensure the SDK files are properly installed
3. Check that the DLL file exists at the specified path

### Serial Port Issues

If the microscope or stage is not responding:
1. Verify the correct COM port is selected
2. Check that the serial port settings match the device requirements
3. For XY stage: Ensure settings are 115200 baud, Even parity, 2 stop bits
4. Ensure no other software is using the same COM port
5. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the USB-serial cable

### Autofocus Not Working (EvidentIX85Win)

If ZDC autofocus is not functioning:
1. Verify you are using EvidentIX85Win (not EvidentIX85)
2. Check that the correct objective is selected
3. Ensure coverslip type is properly configured
4. Verify the ZDC unit is installed on the microscope
5. Check that ZDC has been initialized for the current objective

### Device Not Detected

The EvidentIX85Win adapter performs automatic device detection. If a device is not appearing:
1. Verify the device is physically installed on the microscope
2. Check that the microscope is in remote mode
3. Review the CoreLog for detection messages
4. Ensure the device is supported by your microscope configuration
