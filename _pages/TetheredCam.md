Camera support may depend upon Microsoft Windows version and camera
firmware version used. Camera compatibility can be tested using the
trial version of the Breezesys software.

## Installation

Installation instructions:

-   Go to the [Breezesys](http://www.breezesys.com) web site. Verify
    your camera is supported by
    [PSRemote](http://www.breezesys.com/PSRemote/index.htm) if you have
    a Canon Powershot, [DSLRRemote
    Pro](http://www.breezesys.com/DSLRRemotePro/index.htm) if you have a
    Canon DSLR, or
    [NKRemote](http://www.breezesys.com/NKRemote/index.htm) if you have
    a Nikon DSLR camera.
-   Download, install and configure the program which corresponds to
    your camera (PSRemote, DSLRRemote, or NKRemote). Click on the
    "Release" button to take a picture. Check the picture is downloaded
    to the PC, and displayed in the PSRemote/DSLRRemote/NKRemote main
    window.
-   If you're planning to use raw image files, optionally install the
    [Windows Imaging Component
    codec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Imaging_Component#External_links)
    for your camera's raw image format.
-   With PSRemote, DSLRRemote, or NKRemote still running, start up
    Micro-Manager.
-   Open the Tools menu, and choose Hardware Configuration Wizard.
-   In the "Select the configuration file" window: Click on Next.
-   In the "Add or remove devices" window: Select PSRemoteCamera if you
    use PSRemote, NKRemoteCamera if you use NKRemote, or
    DSLRRemoteCamera if you use DSLRRemote. Click on Add. A small window
    pops up with "Please type in the new device name". Click on OK.
    Click on Done.
-   Back in the "Add or remove devices" window: Click on Next.
-   In the "Edit pre-initialisation settings" window: Click on Next.
-   In the "Setup Serial ports" window: Click on Next.
-   In the "Select default devices" window: Choose "CanonPSCam",
    "NikonDSLRCam" or "CanonDSLRCam" as default camera. Click on Next.
-   In the "Set delays for devices without synchronisation capabilities"
    window: Click on Next.
-   In the "Select devices to synchronize with image acquisition"
    window: Click on Next.
-   In the "Define position labels for state devices" window: Click on
    Next.
-   In the "Save configuration" window: Click "Save and test the new
    configuration". Click on Exit.

You can now use the camera in Micro-Manager.

## Properties

![](media/TetheredCam_settings.png "TetheredCam_settings.png")

The following properties are currently implemented:

Binning  
Binning groups pixels in both x and y direction. Allowable values are 1,
2, 4, 8.

BitDepth  
Specifies the bit depth or dynamic range of the pixel. Actual bit depth
may be less, depending upon the camera image sensor. Allowable values
are "8" and "16".

Exposure  
Exposure sets the exposure time. Units are ms. Setting the exposure time
in Micro-manager requires a properly initialized "ShutterSpeeds" camera
property, and DSLRRemote/NKRemote/PSRemote "Exposure mode" set to "Tv"
or "Manual".

An exposure time of 0 leaves the camera shutter speed unchanged. This
allows setting the shutter speed in DSLRRemote/NKRemote/PSRemote instead
of in Micro-Manager.

ImageDecoder  
Specifies how images are decoded. Allowable values are "Raw", "Raw (no
gamma compensation)", "Raw (no gamma compensation; no white balance)"
and "Windows".

Raw  
Images are decoded using Micro-Manager's internal decoder,
[libraw](http://www.libraw.org). The internal decoder is able to decode
raw images only, not jpeg.

[Color interpolation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosaicing) is used
only if binning is 1. Color interpolation does not take place if binning
is 2 or more. If binning is 2 or more, color samples are averaged.

Decoded images are gamma adjusted for sRGB.

Raw (no gamma compensation)  
Same as "Raw", but decoded images have a linear grayscale.

Raw (no gamma compensation; no white balance)  
Same as "Raw", but decoded images have a linear grayscale, and have no
white balance applied.

Windows  
Images are decoded using [Windows Imaging
Component](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Imaging_Component). The
decoder is able to decode jpeg and, if [Windows Imaging Component
codecs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Imaging_Component#External_links)
have been installed, raw images.

KeepOriginals  
Saves the pictures to disk. Allowable values are 0 and 1. The directory
can be chosen in DSLRRemote, NKRemote or PSRemote File-&gt;Preferences.
The pictures are in the format provided by the camera; typically jpeg or
raw.

PixelType  
When set to Grayscale, converts images to grayscale. Allowable values
are Color and Grayscale.

ShutterSpeeds  
If one wishes to set exposure in Micro-Manager, the "Shutter Speeds"
property has to contain a list of available shutter speed settings,
separated by semicolons. The shutter speeds have to be in the same order
as they appear in the "Tv" drop-down box in
DSLRRemote/NKRemote/PSRemote. Shutter speeds can be floating point
numbers (e.g. 0.25) or fractions (e.g. 1/4). Shutter speeds are
expressed in seconds.

As an example, if a Canon Powershot A80 is used the property
"ShutterSpeeds" should be as follows:

15;13;10;8;6;5;4;3.2;2.5;2;1.6;1.3;1;0.8;0.6;0.5;0.4;0.3;1/4;1/5;1/6;1/8;1/10;1/13;1/15;1/20;1/25;1/30;1/40;1/50;1/60;1/80;1/100;1/125;1/160;1/200;1/250;1/320;1/400;1/500;1/640;1/800;1/1000;1/1250;1/1600;1/2000

TransposeCorrection  
When set, enables TransposeMirrorX, TransposeMirrorY, TransposeXY.
Allowable values are 0 and 1. Transposing is useful if the camera image
is not oriented as you would expect.

TransposeMirrorX  
When set, mirrors image horizontally. Allowable values are 0 and 1.

TransposeMirrorY  
When set, mirrors image vertically. Allowable values are 0 and 1.

TransposeXY  
When set, rotates image. Allowable values are 0 and 1.

## Notes

-   Large images require large amounts of memory. If image acquisition
    works in DSLRRemote/NKremote/PSRemote but fails in micro-manager,
    try increasing memory available and reducing memory used.
    -   Go to ImageJ, choose Edit &gt; Options &gt; Memory and increase
        maximum memory. See [memory
        issues](http://www.micro-manager.org/documentation.php?object=Userguide#mozTocId137215).
    -   Go to Micro-Manager, choose Tools &gt; Options and select
        "Conserve RAM".

<!-- -->

-   Many algorithms in Micro-Manager require grayscale images. Feeding a
    color image to a grayscale-only algorithm typically produces errors
    such as "Unsupported pixel type" or "Invalid data type". Setting
    both "PixelType" to "Grayscale" and "KeepOriginals" to "1" will send
    a grayscale image to Micro-Manager but allow you to read the
    original color images from disk.

<!-- -->

-   If you wish to automatically load your "Shutter Speeds" settings
    upon startup, create a Micro-Manager configuration group called
    "System". In the "System" configuration group, create a preset group
    called "Startup" which includes "Shutter Speeds". These settings
    will be applied every time you start up Micro-Manager.

<!-- -->

-   To get a live view display in DSLRRemote, NKRemote or PSRemote, open
    the "Camera" menu and select "Live View".

<!-- -->

-   This driver is Windows only. To use Canon and Nikon cameras on MacOS
    X and Linux systems see [GPhoto](GPhoto "wikilink").
