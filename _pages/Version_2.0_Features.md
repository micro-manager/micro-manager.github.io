MicroManager 2.0 has many new capabilities and features.

## Image Display Window

-   Histograms, metadata, and other controls are directly attached to
    the image display
-   Fullscreen mode
-   Working "nighttime" mode
-   Can create multiple windows displaying different parts of the same
    dataset (without duplicating the dataset itself)
    -   These windows can be synchronized, so that e.g. you can look at
        the same Z-slice at different timepoints, or use the same
        contrast settings
-   New image overlay system for drawing on top of the image (including
    scale bar and timestamp overlays)
-   Improved scrollbars and better animation controls

## Scripting API

-   Can easily access all aspects of image data and metadata
-   Can directly create and control image windows
-   Can add custom controls and overlays to image windows
-   Can receive notifications of more events related to display and data
    (e.g. the creation of new display windows)
-   Can easily save custom acquisitions as TIFFs

## New data model

-   Image metadata is strongly-typed and clearly documented (untyped
    user metadata can also be attached)
-   Complete display settings are saved as part of the data -- so your
    multi-window setup can be saved and recalled later
-   Can have arbitrary data axes (not just Z/time/channel/position)
    -   NOTE: custom axes are not currently saved!
-   Backwards-compatible with MM1.4 data files

## General improvements

-   Aborted/incomplete acquisitions have the correct dimensions when
    used in ImageJ
-   ImageJ's understanding of the pixel size (including pixel depth)
    should never be inaccurate
