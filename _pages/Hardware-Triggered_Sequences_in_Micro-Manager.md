title: Hardware-Triggered Sequences in Micro-Manager
layout: page
---


 Micro-Manager provides for the precise and rapid
triggering of sequences of channels and focus positions by the camera.

### Channels

LED illuminators and AOTF-based laser combiners both have very fast
switching times, and are thus prime candidates for hardware
synchronization.

### Focal drives

Piezo z stages move rapidly enough such that a sequence of z positions
can be synchronized with a camera running at tens of frames per second.

### Multi-Dimensional Acquisition

Micro-Manager's multi-dimensional acquisition (MDA) engine practices
opportunistic triggering: that is, if a triggered sequence is possible,
then triggering will be carried out. Thus the user interface for
triggered MDA is exactly the same as that for non-triggered MDA.

### Controller devices that currently support triggered sequences
