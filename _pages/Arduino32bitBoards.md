------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Arduino32bitBoards device adapter contains extra features compared
to the regular [Arduino](Arduino "wikilink") device adapter.

Currently the Teensy 3.5 is the recommended board to be used with this
device adapter, bur there is also firmware available for the teensy 3.2,
ESP32 and feather M4.

Differences compared to regular Arduino Device Adapter:

-   Two extra output channels to a total of 8
-   Added Pulse-width modulation (PWM) control
-   Unified DAC and PWM
-   Unified digital-out channels and DAC/PWM channels, this allows
    DAC/PWM blanking on all 8 channels
-   Changed unit of DAC/ PWM from "Volt" to "Power %" and the default
    scale to 0-100
-   In the Firmware: Channels 1 - 2 are by default DAC channels,
    channels 3-8 are by default PWM

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Arduino 32 Bit-boards in general

**Advantages:**

-   Much faster, because of higher clock speed and more work performed
    per clockcycle.
-   Baudrate increased to 500 000, nearly 9 times the transferspeed
    between Arduino and Micro-Manager (there are some exceptions). This
    can be even increased to 2 000 000, with micro-manager 2
-   Most 32-bit Arduinos have a build-in DAC (max 3.3V output)
-   Higher PWM frequencies and PWM bitresolutions
-   More flexibility with pins used

**Disadvantages:**

-   **Most are not 5V tolerant**, this means you'll need voltage level
    converter when using the triggerpin. It is recommended to use Teensy
    3.5 since this board does have 5V tolerant inputs. When using a not
    5V tolerant board it is recommended to use a voltage level converter
    like this one [link](https://www.adafruit.com/product/757) or this
    one [link](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009)

## Installation and Drivers

This Section is an overview of the installation links for Arduino and
the respective boards

### Arduino IDE

Arduino offers two solutions, an online editor and a local Integrated
development environment (IDE) program. It is recommended to use the
local IDE software. The page for the software can be found
[here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

### Adafruit

Adafruit makes two programming environments to use on their 32-bit
boards. One is circuit python and Arduino. Circuitpython currently
doesn't work with micro-manager. Guide for installing the Adafruit
Feather M4 board can be found
[here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m4-express-atsamd51/setup).
Just the driver can be downloaded from
[here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Windows_Drivers/releases/latest).
This also includes multiple drivers that work on many other boards as
well.

### Esp32

ESP32 arduino core installation link can be found
[here](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md).
Also when using an windows version older than Windows 10 driver
installation might be needed. There are two types of USB to serial chips
used with each their own driver. If you are not sure what IC is used
just install both drivers.

These two are the most common type of drivers:

-   [SiLabs
    cp210x](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
-   [CH340](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/4/CH341SER.EXE)

### Teensy Boards

Teensy requires its own installation software that can be downloaded
[here](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html). Just the drivers
can be found [here](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/serial_install.exe).
