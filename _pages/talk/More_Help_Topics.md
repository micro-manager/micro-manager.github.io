Is it possible to save the exposure time, gain and other necessary
information in µ-Manager while data acquisition?

Is it possible to save the exposure time, gain and other necessary
information in µ-Manager while data acquisition? I don't want to write
this information in the file name manually, instead, this should be
automatically saved in the .tif file format.

Thanks Jaladhar
