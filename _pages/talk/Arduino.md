## Minor Improvements

Decimal &lt;-&gt; Binary conversion  

:\* Augment / replace Roy's table by linking to a suitable, but minimal,
online tutorial. It should be relevant to the goal of converting between
decimal and binary and doing the math to add pins.

:\* Bonus- link to a calculator where one can click on the bits and see
the decimal and binary values.
[Poke-A-Bit](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/Paddle2See/59348) is nice,
but buggy; the buttons stop working after a few clicks

Hardware Configuration Wizard  

:\* All the features are not clearly described with appropriate
nomenclature. This should be done while actually using an Arduino.

Trigger mode  

:\* Link to Arduino sequence acquisition Beanshell script

:\* Clean description of how the Arduino functions in non-Sequence and
Sequence modes

## Major Improvements (as in requiring more effort)

Daughter DA board  
Although mentioned in the Overview it needs to be documented so that
someone can reproduce it- maybe another page should be created for this,
and we link to that page from here. Ideally, the following should be
added:

-   Functional capabilities of the board (how many AOTF channels can it
    control?)
-   Photos of result
-   Bill of Materials
-   Electrical Schematic (make in Fritzing)
-   Production (submit to Ponoko, or Sparkfun, etc)
