## Monochrome Only ?!

I have a QICAM Fast RGB camera that runs in monochrome at 2x2 binning. I
have v2.0.5 of the QCam driver installed. ÂµManager returns:

Error code 22: Device QCamera. Only monochrome cameras are supported in
uManager.

Is there a way around this?

-REPLY 10/12/2010 by Fred at PMQI Using micromanager, the answer is no
(and is not QCam dependent). Using ImageJ, in conjunction with the
imagej plugin that gets installed with QCapture Suite, the answer is
yes. However, the interface that you see is what you would normally see
in QCapture Suite. So manual intensive approach for multiple image
capture
