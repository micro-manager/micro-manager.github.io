It would be useful to document e2v image saturation.

There are 3 saturation conditions:

1.  A2D convertor saturated, no blooming
2.  Pixel wells saturated, vertical blooming
3.  EM register saturated, horizontal blooming

This would require creating copyright images of the sensor as well as
the of specimens to show the different types of saturation.
