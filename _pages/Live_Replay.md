While looking at a live image stream, you sometimes notice something
interesting that is worth looking at again. This plugin will let you do
so. The **Live Replay** plugin will find all images that are in
Micro-Manager's internal buffer and will display these in a 5D image
viewer. You can change the size of the internal (sequence) buffer (and
hence the number of images that you can 'recall') using the Options
dialog (**Tools\|Options**).
