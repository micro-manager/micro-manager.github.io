The Omicron Laser Controller controls Omicron LuxX®, PhoxX® and BrixX®
series lasers as well as lasers integrated in LightHUB® compact laser
combiners and SOLE® laser light engines via their serial interfaces (USB
Port - all models, RS232 Port - for LuxX® and BrixX® series lasers only
available with an optional break out cable). In the hardware
configuration wizard you will need to add one Omicron Laser Controller
object for every “…xX”-laser device you would like to control.

The following laser features and operating modes can be controlled
and/or monitored through µ-manager device/property browser:

**Read only properties:**

-   Device type
-   Serial number
-   Specified power
-   Wavelength
-   Workinghours
-   Temperature baseplate
-   Temperature diode
-   Error notification

**Read/Write properties:**

-   Laser operation select (turns the laser emission ON or Off)
-   Laser operatingmode select (CW, analogue and/or digital modulation,
    standby)
-   Laser CW sub-operatingmode select (ACC-Auto Current Control or
    APC-Auto Power Control; only available with connected LuxX or BrixX
    laser module)
-   Laser power set-point select (set the laser power level in \[mW\] or
    \[ %\])
-   Reset

{% include notice icon="info" content="Laser emission will be automatically shut off at µ-Manager start up. Laser emission can be turned back on as desired by the “Laser Operation Select” property." %}

{% include notice icon="info" content="Laser properties show the values of the last polling, simply click the “Refresh” button of the device/property browser to get the actual values. Adhoc communication of the laser is automatically disabled at µ-Manager start up." %}

{% include notice icon="info" content="Laser emission will automatically shut off when µ-manager is shut down." %}

Below you can see a screenshot of an Omicron “…xX”-Laser Series module
controlled via the device/property browser:

## Cobolt Laser Controller

If you want to control a Cobolt laser integrated in your Omicron
LightHUB® compact laser combiner or SOLE® laser light engine via USB
port you can use the Cobolt device adaptor provided by Karl Bellve.

Please first have a look at the device manager to find out the Virtual
COM Port the Cobolt laser is connected to. After that please add an
Cobolt device adaptor in the hardware configuration wizard and make the
following settings:

![](media/Omicron2.png "Omicron2.png")

-   Max Power: Fill in the Max Power of your Cobolt laser (mW)
-   Port: Select the Virtual COM Port of your Cobolt laser

<!-- -->

-   Port Properties: Set up the properties as shown in the picture above

{% include notice icon="info" content="Use a BaudRate of '''115200''' - a BaudRate of 19200 (as noted in the description of the Cobold device adapter) will not work!" %}

After you have done this settings Micro Manager will connect to your
cobolt laser and you can control the laser by the device/property
browser.

&lt;include notice icon="info" content="If your Cobolt laser is CDRH configured it will
not start using the Cobolt-Laser--&gt;"ON" property - please first
toggle the key switch - now the laser will turn ON after sending the
command!😎"&gt;
