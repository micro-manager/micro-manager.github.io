Sometimes ImageJ and Micro-Manager images show strange blocky artifacts
on Windows XP. You may be able to fix this problem by turning off
Direct3D for Java. To do so, set the following environment variable in
your system:

    Variable: J2D_D3D
    Value: false

(To edit environment variables, right click on My Computer, select
Properties &gt; Advanced &gt; Environment Variables)
