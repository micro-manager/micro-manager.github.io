please check out the corresponding product documentation on the [MATRIX
VISION](http://www.matrix-vision.com) homepage. As Micro-Manager offers
a dynamic property interface in a similar way the underlying mvIMPACT
Acquire SDK embedded within this adapter does, almost all properties
offered by the device driver will automatically become available in
Micro-Manager as well
