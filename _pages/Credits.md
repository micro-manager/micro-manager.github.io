Micro-Manager is being developed by Mark Tsuchida at the [Laboratory for
Optical and Computational Instrumentation at the University of
Wisconsin, Madison](https://eliceirilab.org/) with help from [Nico
Stuurman](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/external/people/directory.html) in the
[laboratory](http://valelab.ucsf.edu) of [Ron
Vale](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/external/people/directory.html) at [the
University of California San Francisco](http://www.ucsf.edu).

Initial software development and architecture was by [Nenad
Amodaj](http://nenad.amodaj.com). Others who worked on Micro-Manager are
Chris Weisiger, [Arthur
Edelstein](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/external/people/directory.html),
[Henry Pinkard](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/external/people/directory.html),
[Karl
Hoover](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/external/people/directorypast.html),
[Ziah Dean](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/external/people/directorypast.html),
and [Oleksiy
Danihkhno](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/external/people/directorypast.html).
Major contributions to the source code have been made by
[100XImaging](http://100ximaging.com). Many other companies and
individuals have contributed code for device control, including ABS
Cameras, ASI, Andor, Lumencor, Mad City Labs, Motic, Physik Instrumente,
Stanford Photonics, PCO, QImaging, ScopeLED, Karl Bellve, Peter Topor,
Ji Yu, Brian Ashcroft, Jeffrey Kuhn, Karl Hoover, and Roy Wollman. The
project was initially funded by grants from the Sandler Foundation,
grant 5R01EB007187 from the NIH, and is now funded by the [CZI's Open
source
Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-awards-5-million-for-open-source-software-projects-essential-to-science/).

Micro-Manager is built by extensively using other open source components
and applications:

Especially important precursor contributions for our project are from
Wayne Rasband (ImageJ).

Development of Micro-Manager has only been possible thanks to the
endurance of our early beta-testers, i.e. several members of the Vale
lab (Eric Griffis, Andrew Carter, Gohta Goshima and others). Many thanks
to Kurt Thorn and the [Nikon Imaging Center at
UCSF](http://nic.ucsf.edu/) for help, testing, great ideas and
suggestions. We are grateful for support (in the form of documentation,
information, and/or use of equipment) from many microscope hardware
vendors, including ASI, Andor, DVC, Stanford Photonics, Hamamatsu,
Prior, Solamer, Nikon, and Zeiss.

And of course, many thanks Ron for making it all happen.
