This adapter makes the parallel port available as a digital output
device, i.e., it provides a way of setting TTLs. It uses
[inpout.dll](http://www.logix4u.net/inpout32.htm) to talk to the
parallel port. The pins in the parallel port are set using a single
binary value, where each position in the number corresponds to a pin in
the port.

For instance:  
1023 (1111111111) will set pins 1 through 10 high  
0 (0000000000) will set pins 1 through 10 low  
6 (0110000000) will set pins 2 and 3 high and all others low.  
{% include Note text="This adapter does not provide a shutter device.  The [[AOTF]] adapter provides a shutter that can set pins of the parallel port." %}

&lt;INCLUDE Note text="On Windows Vista and later, you may need to run
Micro-Manager as administrator (right-click and choose "Run as
administrator" from an admin account) the first time you access the
parallel port.ðŸ˜Ž"&gt;
