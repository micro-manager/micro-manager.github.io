Requires the [OASIS
Software](http://www.objectiveimaging.com/download/software.php) package
from Objective Imaging.

Here is the direct link to
[OASIS V511 (6b)](http://objectiveimaging.com/download/files/OASIS_V511_(6b).zip)
with drivers compatible with Windows 10.

If the zip package is not available from Objective Imaging anymore, it
may still be available from

## Objective Imaging OASIS-4i / OASIS-Blue controller board

Both the OASIS-4i and the OASIS-blue are four-axis controllers intended
to address a wide range of automated applications in microscopy. The
four-axis design of the controller makes it ideally suited for use with
automated microscopes with a combination of the following components:

-   Motorized XY stage, for fast and precise translation of the specimen
-   Motorized Z focus drive, for autofocus and Z-stack acquisition
-   Motorized filter changer(s), for wavelength selection, e.g.,
    fluorescence
-   Shutter control and other isolated TTL GPIO lines.

The OASIS-blue can be configured to support automated components from a
variety of 3rd party vendors, and Objective Imaging supplies a range of
cabling options that ensure simple connection of the OASIS-blue to a
particular configuration. For any additional information, [please
contact Objective Imaging](http://www.objectiveimaging.com/contact.php).

Note that your OASIS-blue controller may have been provided as part of
an integrated automation system. There may be aspects of your system
configuration that are specialized for your application. In these
situations, please contact your system vendor for details regarding your
configuration before proceeding.

Additionally, both the OASIS-4i / OASIS-Blue can be fitted with optional
daughter modules to provide enhanced capabilities such as encoder
support and digital trigger I/O.

## Installation

The Controller User Guide can be downloaded [from this
link](http://www.objectiveimaging.com/download/software.php) and is
bundled together with the OASIS-Blue and OASIS-4i System Software ZIP
file.

## Hardware Configuration Wizard

Add the Objective Imaging Oasis Controller Hub. This change was
introduced in v1.4.23. In versions prior, only XY control was provided,
so a hub was not necessary. ![](/media/Oasis1.png)

Then select whichever hardware the OASIS board controls. E.g.,
OasisXYStage, OasisZStage, OasisShutter\_1...
