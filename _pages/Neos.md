This adapter lets you use a [NEOS AOTF](http://www.neostech.com/)(and
other shutter devices that can be controlled with a TTL) as a shutter
using just your PCs parallel port. The pins on the parallel port are
addressed using a binary mask with a maximum value of 1024 (so that you
can address the first 10 pins of the parallel port, see the
[ParallelPort](ParallelPort "wikilink") for examples). Each pin (or a
combination thereof) can be declared to be a shutter.

In general, it is a better approach to use a DAQ board to control an
AOTF (since that will also give you control of intensity). However, this
adapter might still be useful as it provides TTLs in a very
cost-effective way.

This adapter uses the
[inpout.dll](http://www.logix4u.net/inpout32.htm)to talk to the parallel
port.
