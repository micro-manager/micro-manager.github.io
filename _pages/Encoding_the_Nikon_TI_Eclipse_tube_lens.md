title: Encoding the Nikon TI Eclipse tube lens
layout: page
---

The Nikon TI Eclipse is a fine motorized microscope, however, its
designers forgot one little detail. The tube lens switcher can switch
between a 1x and 1.5x tube lens but since it is not encoded there is no
way for software controlling the microscope to know the magnification of
the image. Of course, a diligent microscopist will take note of the
position of that switch and it is even possible in Micro-Manager to add
a "dummy" tube lens switcher, however, more often then not, you will end
up in a situation where you are not certain whether you used the 1x or
1.5x tube lens, basically rendering a data set useless.

To remedy this problem, I started encoding the tube lens switcher
myself. The three main components to do so are:

-   Hall effect sensor. These are small devices that change output
    voltage depending on the presence of an electric field. This
    write-up is for the the A3214EUA-T (inscribed with EA1) from
    Allegro. It is no longer available. I am currently using the
    A1126LUA-T (also from Allegro). Although the ground and Vout should
    be switched for this model (according to the data sheet), things
    work much better if you do not (i.e. keep them as shown below).
-   Magnet. You want a magnet that fits into the screw hole of the tube
    lens switcher. Buckeyballs (no longer available) and
    [Neocubes](http://www.theneocube.com/) do a great job at this. You
    need only one of them (hope they are still available)!
-   An [Arduino](http://arduino.org) board. Most of the standard boards
    (including the Uno) will do fine. This will provide power to the
    Hall effect sensor, read out its state and signal this to the
    Micro-Manager software.

To put everything together, I also used:

-   Four stranded telephone wire (from the RadioShack)
-   Telephone wire crimp connectors (see picture below)
-   Arduino-compatible [jumper
    wires](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11026)
-   An [Arduino enclosure](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10088)

You can exchange these for anything else that works.

I connected the Hall effect sensor to the telehone wire using crimp
connectors: ![](media/Sensorb.jpg "fig:media/Sensorb.jpg")

Then hooked up the telephone wire to the Arduino using the same crimp
connectors and M/M jumper wires. Note, the Hall effect sensor needs 5V
power (red wire) and ground (white/black cables), all provided by the
Arduino and its output (green wire) can be connected to the A0 pin on
the Arduino. I used a knot in the telephone wire to protect against
problems arising from cable pull. ![](media/Arduinob.jpg "fig:media/Arduinob.jpg")

Close the box (you do not need to put the stickers on):

Now put the Buckeyball magnet in the screw hole in the tube lens changer
and position the Hall effect sensor right underneath. Fasten the sensor
using thick double sticky foam (put some souble sticky foam over the
sensor as well to make sure it does not break loose). Turning the know
will bring the magnet out of reach of the Hall effect sensor.

Load the AOTF firmware into the Arduino board. Configure Micro-Manager
to use the Arduino-Input device. Set the pull up resistor property to
"On". You can either use just pin 0 or all pins. In the device property
browser, you should see the value of this read-only input property
change when the magnet is close to the hall effect sensor (the input
updates automatically every second). Add this property to the pixel size
configuration and Micro-Manager will always know the exact pixel size.
