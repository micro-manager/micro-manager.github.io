To use Apogee cameras with Micro-Manager, you will need to download the
[Windows driver](http://www.ccd.com/downloads.html) (v. 3.10 or above)
from Apogee.

In the hardware configuration wizard, you will need to set the ID for
CameraOne (and optionally CameraTwo). If the ID you provide is -1, then
the driver will prompt you to "Find" the camera. If the ID you provide
is nonnegative, then the driver should find the Camera without
displaying its device search window.
