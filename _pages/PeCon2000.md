Device Adapter for [PeCon](http://www.pecon.biz/) [Series
2000](http://www.pecon.biz/?page_id=126) Incubation Controllers
(Temperature/Gas, connected via USB). Available in the nightly builds as
of August 04, 2016. The Device Adapter is built as a hub device, which
enumerates all connected PeCon Series 2000 controllers.

You can control the desired value (*Setpoint*), read the current value
(*ActualValue*), and set whether the controller should control towards
the setpoint (*LoopControl*).

Status of the device and control channel is available in three variants:
*Numeric* as numeric value and *Identifier* as short string value for
scripting usages, and *Message* as human readable message.

Keypad access can be blocked by *KeypadBlocked*, however to retain the
lock, the device must be queried (by reading the *Status* properties) at
least every 5 seconds.

Thanks go to Dr. Oliver Merk of PeCon for providing the SDK as well as
for testing and discussions. If you encounter any error, please contact
the author.
