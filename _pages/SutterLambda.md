## Device Configuration

### Serial port issues

Sutter devices use a straight through (i.e., not null modem) DB9 serial
cable. The default baud rates are 9600 for serial ports and 128000 for
USB ports (which use a build-in USB-serial converter, drivers can be
found [here](http://www.sutter.com/SOFTWARE/imaging.html))

### Wheel speed

95% of the time speed `#1` works best (`#0` being the fastest, which
only works with an empty wheel). If speed `#1` does not work you can try
the slowest (speed `#7` IIRC). Best practice is to [set the desired
wheel speed during
startup](Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide#startup-presets),
i.e. in your `Startup` Preset of the `System` Group.

### Lambda SC

For the Lambda SC Smart shutter controller, select the
"Shutter-A\|Lambda 10 shutter A" in the Hardware Configuration Wizard.

## Troubleshooting

### Wheel re-homing during imaging

You need to optimize the filter speed setting if you ever encounter the
dreaded re-homing sound due to the wheel failing to move to a filter
position during Multi-Dimensional Acquisition. The wheel itself has a
resonance frequency associated with the load of filters. Practically one
finds the ideal speed by empirically checking which speed introduces the
least vibration.

See the Operation Manual (available at <http://www.sutter.com/>) section
"Helpful Tips about Filter Wheel Movement Errors".

### Note

Newer devices from Sutter are supported in the
[SutterLambda2](SutterLambda2) adapter. If you would like to
add support for a Sutter device that is currently unsupported please add
your code to the newer adapter.
