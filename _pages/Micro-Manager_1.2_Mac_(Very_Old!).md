# <span class="sbig">Micro-Manager Previous Versions for Mac OS X </span>

[Installation
Notes](https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/MMweb/downloads.php?object=main)  
  
Mount the disk image and copy the folder to your Applications folder.
Run ImageJ (from /Applications/Micro-Manager1.2). The application
contains ImageJ and the
[WCIF](http://www.uhnresearch.ca/facilities/wcif/imagej/) collection of
plugins. When upgrading, make sure that your configuration file is not
overwritten. Note that version 1.1 and higher require OS X 10.4, whereas
version 1.0 will run on OS X 10.3 (this is because version 1.1 requires
java 1.5 or higher, which is available on the Mac only as of OS X
10.4).
