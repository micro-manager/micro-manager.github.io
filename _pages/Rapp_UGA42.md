------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Rapp UGA-42 is a galvanometer-based laser targeting system for
photobleaching, photoactivation, and other phototargeting applications.
It uses galvo mirrors to precisely position laser beams through the
microscope objective to target specific locations in the specimen.

This device adapter is similar to the original [Rapp](Rapp) adapter for
the UGA-40, but is designed for the newer UGA-42 hardware.

The Micro-Manager [Projector Plugin](Projector_Plugin) allows microscope 
operators to calibrate the UGA42 with the camera and to draw spots or 
regions of interest on an image and phototarget these areas
using the UGA-42.

## Features

- Multi-laser support (Laser 1 through 4
- Point-and-fire capability for single-spot targeting
- Polygon support for complex ROI targeting
- Sequence automation for programmed scanning patterns
- TTL triggering with configurable edge detection

## Properties

| Property            | Description                                                                                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LaserPor            | Selects which laser to use (Laser 1 - 4)                                                 |
| LaserIntensity      | Controls analog voltage send to the laser, hence laser intensity                                    |
| LaserType           | Continuous or pulsed             |
| MaxIntensity        | Max Laser Intensity  |
| MinIntensity        | Minimum Laser Intensity |
| SpotSize            | Laser spot diameter for ROI rastering calculations, relative number of unknown dimensions              |
| TTLTriggerBehavior        | For TTL triggering, selects Rising Edge or Falling Edge                                         |
| TTLTriggerMode      | Select "None" for software control.  I have not yet tested other modes, but they should work." |
| TickTime            | The UGA 42 has an internal "clock" and operates with sequential time slots ("ticks"),  This property sets the duration of a tick in microseconds.  Default is 50, minimum is 40, maximum is 1000.  |


## Installation

The UGA-42 requires the files "obsTools.dll" and "ROE UGA-42 SDK.DLL" in the micro-manager installation directory.  The code was build agains UGA-42 SDK_1139, and it can not be guaranteed that other versions will work.  If you do not have these files, please contact Rapp support and request them.  The Rapp UGA42 should be auto-detected.  Leave the debug property set to false (setting it to true will dramatizally slow down communication with the device).  This device adapter currently only supports one UGA42.
