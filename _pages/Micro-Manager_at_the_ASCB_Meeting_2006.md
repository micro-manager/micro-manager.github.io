Micro-Manager was succesfully announced and presentedÂ at the
[ASCB](http://www.ascb.org/) meeting in [San Diego, December
9-12](http://www.ascb.org/meetings/am2006/index.cfm). We provided a
hands-on demonstration on Nikon and Zeiss microscopes and various
imaging equipment, using both Windows and Mac computers.

We were very encouraged by the interest and overwhelmingly positive
response both from the user community and from the industry. Thanks
everyone for stopping by our booth!
