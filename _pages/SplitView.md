There are some devices on the market that can split an image into 2 (or
more) wavelength components and project these side by side on a camera
(examples are the [Dual
View](http://www.magbiosystems.com/products/DV2.php) and the
[OptoSplit](http://www.cairn-research.co.uk/Products/Fluorescence/Fluorescence20II20Splitter)).
The SplitView plugin (under the **Plugins \| SplitView** menu entry)
will display the acquired images as a two channel Image in the 5D-Image
viewer. You can set the color of each channel and use either a
left-right or top-bottom split.
