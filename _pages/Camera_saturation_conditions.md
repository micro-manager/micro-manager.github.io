## Types of saturation

There are 3 places at which you can saturate EMCCD data:

1.  Analog-to-Digital (A2D) convertor
2.  Pixel electron wells on sensor
3.  EM register on sensor

To demonstrate all 3 conditions, the following specimens were imaged
with a 60x objective using a Confocal spinning disk and 488nm laser:

-   Mixed pollen grains
-   Fluorescent pin holes (i.e. green uniformity fluorescent slide with
    stopped Nipkow disk)

### Condition 1: A2D convertor saturated, no blooming

### Condition 2: pixel wells saturated, vertical blooming

### Condition 3: EM register saturated, horizontal blooming

## Conclusion

When using EM gain avoid using less than the highest pre-amp \[1\], but
if you need it, use a low value equal to the readout noise of the speed
selected.

    ...it is only ever recommended selecting something other than the
    default highest PreAmp (most sensitive) setting for applications
    that are extremely challenged by dynamic range concerns. It is very
    important, however, that for such high-dynamic range applications,
    the user applies even more care to the amount of EM gain applied
    (high EM gain can drastically reduce the true dynamic range of the
    camera). Ideally, for maximum dynamic range whilst maintaining
    improved Signal to Noise (S/N), the EM gain setting should be set
    equal to the read noise at the readout speed selected (value
    obtainable from the performance sheet that comes with the delivered
    system).
