These abstract devices can be used to change the function of a real
device or to combine multiple real devices into a single, logical
device.

## Multi-Shutter

Combines multiple shutters into a single logical shutter, opens and
closes multiple shutters simultaneously. You will need to set the
"Physical Shutter: properties (up to 5 shutters can be set). It is
easiest to set these in the "System" "Startup" group so that they will
be set automatically upon loading the configuration file.

## Multi-Camera

Combines multiple cameras into a single logical camera. Snapping an
image with a multi-camera device will result in a single multi-channel
image, where each image is taken with one camera. Some cameras may not
be fully supported (at this point in time, the demo and Andor cameras
work with the adapter; at least Hamamatsu Flash4 and PCO Edge also
work).

**Setup**

1.  The cameras must have the same width, height and pixeltype (or
    strange things may happen).
2.  For multiple cameras using the same DeviceAdapter, add that
    DeviceAdapter as many times as there are cameras.
3.  Assign the Multi-Camera "Physical Camera" properties to your
    cameras. Best practice is to also add these "Physical Camera"
    properties in the "System" group's "Startup" preset, to set them
    automatically upon loading the configuration file as described in
    the [ Configuration
    Guide](Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide#startup-presets "wikilink").
4.  Synchronizing cameras requires wiring the exposure digital output of
    one camera (namely, the "Master" camera) to the trigger input of
    other cameras (the "Slave" camera(s)).

    {% include notice icon="info" content="The Master must be the last numbered
    `Physical Camera`, since several frames can be acquired by one
    camera before the next camera starts acquiring. e.g. Set `Physical
    Camera 1` to Slave, and `Physical Camera 2` to Master." %}
5.  To rotate or mirror images, launch the [Image Flipper
    plugin](Image_Flipper "wikilink"). The plugin only works while it is
    open. Also after restarting Micro-Manager, to apply mirror and flip
    settings, one has to click through the top listbox of the plugin and
    select each camera that has flip and/or rotate settings enabled to
    load its settings.

Going "Live" using the Multi-Camera adapter controlling large sensor
cameras can crash Micro-Manager in versions earlier than 1.4.16.
Improvements to the core have fixed this issue.

## Multi Stage

Combines two physical 1D stages into a single logical 1D stage. The
scale factor and offset for both physical stages are specified as
properties. Make sure to specify the properties "PhysicalStage-1" and
"PhysicalStage-2" (e.g. in System-&gt;Startup group preset).

## Combo XY Stage

Combines two physical 1D stages into a single logical 2D stage. The
scale factor and offset for both physical stages are specified as
properties. Make sure to specify the properties "PhysicalStage-X" and
"PhysicalStage-Y" (e.g. in System-&gt;Startup group preset).

## Single Axis Stage

Takes a single axis of a 2D stage and treats it as a 1D stage. Make sure
to specify the properties "PhysicalStage" and "PhysicalAxis" (e.g. in
System-&gt;Startup group preset).

## DA-Shutter

Uses a DA (digital to analogue) device as a shutter. Use the property
"DA Device" to determine which DA device should act as the shutter.
Closing the DA Shutter will result in 0V on the DA output, opening the
DA shutter will result in the voltage set in the DA device itself to
appear on the output. For this device to work correctly, some code needs
to be implemented in the DA device adapter, which appears to be done for
all DA devices currently supported by Micro-Manager.

## DA-Z-Stage

Uses a DA device to set the position of a Z-stage that is connected to
the DA device. This is especially useful for several piezo stages whose
position can be controlled with a voltage. You will need to set
pre-initialization properties determining the minimum and maximum
voltage to be applied on the DA and the Z positions these correspond to.
The DA device itself should be set after initialization and can best be
added to the System Startup group.

## DA-XY-Stage

Similar to the DA-Z-Stage adapter, but now sets to DA devices
simultanuously, one corresponding to the X-stage, the other to the
Y-stage.

## DA-TTL-State-Device

Given 1 to 8 analog output (DA) devices, the DATTLStateDevice will
provide a virtual device that combines the DA devices into a single 1-
to 8-bit digital (TTL) output device. Each DA device works as a 1-bit
digital output line.

## Autofocus Stage

Can be used to operate the 'offset' function of a hardware autofocus
device (such as the Nikon Perfect Focus and Zeiss Definite Focus) as a
Z-drive.

## State-Device-Shutter

To be used to convert a state device (such as a filter wheel) into a
shutter. To use it you will need to set the "State Device Shutter"
property to the desired state device. The state device should have a
property that sets the "closed" position.
