------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Rapp UGA-40 uses galvos to bounce lasers through the microscope
objective and target particular spots on the specimen in the image
plane. The galvos can also be rastered to illuminate a region of
interest. Micro-Manager [Projector Plugin](Projector_Plugin)
allows users to draw one or more spots or regions of interest on an
image of the specimen, and phototarget these areas using the UGA-40.
(The Projector Plugin permits both ad hoc phototargeting and planning
targeting events embedded in a multi-dimensional acquisition).

The UGA-40 supports up to two lasers of different colors. Choose which
laser to use by setting the "Laser" property to "1" or "2".

A few UGA-40-specific properties allow fine-grained control,
supplementing the generic controls presented by the Projector Plugin.
These include:

| Property            | Description                                                                                            |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CalibrationMode     | If "On", laser is turned on regardless of targeting status                                             |
| TTLTriggered        | For TTL triggering, determines whether triggering occurs on a rising or falling edge                   |
| SpotSize            | Tells the UGA-40 controller how large the measured spot size is, for help with rastering extended ROIs |
| RasterFrequency\_Hz | Controls the speed of ROI rastering                                                                    |
| AccuracyPercent     | Controls how precisely an irregular ROI is filled in during rastering                                  |
| OnMinimumRectSize   | Determines the smallest tile used during rastering                                                     |
| Sequence            | Allows a "sequence script" to be uploaded to the UGA-40 controller (rarely used)                       |

## Installation

For Micro-Manager 1.4.15, you need to copy two files, ROEobsTools.dll
and obsROE\_Device.dll, provided by Rapp, into the Micro-Manager folder.
They need to be the "VS2008" version (32- or 64-bit, matching
Micro-Manager).

Micro-Manager nightly builds since late Nov 2013 include all necessary
files and require no additional steps. (However, the DLLs included in
the nightly builds are not compatible with MM 1.4.15 or with nightly
builds up to mid-November, 2013.)
