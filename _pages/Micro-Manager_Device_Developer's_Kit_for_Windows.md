The Device Developer's Kit contains all source code and instructions
required for building Micro-Manager device adapters. The major version
number corresponds to the matching Micro-Manager Device API version.
Using this kit you can build device adapters completely independent of
the rest of the Micro-Manager code base, i.e. without the need to set up
complicated build environments, or to understand or access MMCore and
user interface source code.

As well as downloading and installing the Device Developer's Kit
(installer downloads below), you will need to read the instruction
manual: [Building Micro-Manager Device
Adapters](Building_Micro-Manager_Device_Adapters "wikilink").

## Latest release

As of Micro-manager release 1.4.6 (September 2, 2011) Device Kit is a
part of the source code and there is no need to download and install
stand-alone libraries and executables. All development tools and
libraries can be built directly from the main source code base following
a simple process described in [Building Micro-Manager Device
Adapters](Building_Micro-Manager_Device_Adapters "wikilink").
Distribution of separate Device Kit installers is therefore
discontinued.

Despite some minor cleanup, Device Kit functionality is unchanged: it
allows developers to develop and test Device Adapters using a low-level
C++ environment. No changes are required to Device Adapters developed
with the previous versions of the Device Kit, except making sure that
`MMDevice` directory path is now pointing to the main code base. We
recommend that you delete or move old Device Kit files to avoid
confusion and bugs related to different versions of the interface.

Main advantage of the new source-code based Device Kit is that it never
gets out of sync with the main code base. Developers just have to check
out the latest code from the repository without the need to install any
additional libraries or tools. Also, by following directory structure
described in the new Device Kit, deployment and transfer of newly
developed Device Adapters should be easier than before.
