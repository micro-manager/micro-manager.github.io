The Slide Explorer plugin works like Google Maps for your microscope.
With this plugin you can:

-   Develop a map of the slide in real time by panning and zooming.
-   Move the stage to your desired point of interest with a single
    click.
-   Acquire tiled images with arbitrary shapes, including time lapse, z
    stacks, and multiple channels.

The Slide Explorer is available in Micro-Manager 1.3.46 or later. Before
using the Slide Explorer, you will need to run the [Pixel Calibrator
plugin](Pixel_Calibrator_Plugin "wikilink"). The size and orientation of
pixels measured by the Pixel Calibrator will be used to ensure that the
tiles in the Slide Explorer are properly positioned.
