The Thorlabs DCxxxx adapter operates the [DC2100 - High Power LED
Driver](http://www.thorlabs.de/NewGroupPage9.cfm?ObjectGroup_ID=4003&pn=DC2100&CFID=709850&CFTOKEN=40518309),
the DC2010 - Universal LED Driver, the DC3100 - FLIM LED Driver, the
[DC4100 - 4 Channel LED
Driver](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=3832)
and the [DC2200 - High Power LED
Driver](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=9117).

This adapter makes the LED driver usable as a shutter in Micro-Manager.
On startup, the adapter will switch the LED off. The adapter has several
properties that can be used to control the LED driver.

To operate the DC2200 or DC4100, the [Thorlabs DC2200 software
package](https://www.thorlabs.com/software_pages/ViewSoftwarePage.cfm?Code=DC2200)
has to be installed. In general, if this adapter is greyed out in the
Hardware Configuration Wizard, try installing the DC2200 software.
