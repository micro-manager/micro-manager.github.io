------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Versions

**FlyCap2 version 2.13.3.61 is required.** Micro-Manager versions older
than the 2 February 2022 nigthly build require FlyCap2 version
2.10.3.266. Still older versions like 2.9.3.43 do not work.

This device adapter does not work for Micro-Manager versions from
2022-02-02 to 2023-08-10.

## Installation

Install the [FlyCap2 viewer
software](https://www.ptgrey.com/support/downloads) for your OS. Make
sure that the FlyCapture2 software works with your camera. Copy
libiomp5md.dll and FlyCapture2\_v140.dll (from the bin or bin64
directory in the FlyCap2 directory, you may need to install the full
SDK to find these files) to the Micro-Manager directory
(default: C:\\Program Files\\Micro-Manager). Since we are not allowed
to re-distribute FlyCapture2\_v140.dll, it may well be that 2.13.3.61
is no longer available (in which case you should ask Point Grey for a
copy of 2.13.3.61 or re-build the Micro-Manager Point Grey Device
adapter against the then available SDK).

You will need an account with PT Grey before you can access the
downloads:

## Device Configuration

1.  Open Micromanager.
2.  You will be prompted to load a configuration file. To create a new
    configuration file use "Tools" &gt; "Hardware Configuration
    Wizard..." to add the camera. If "Point Grey" is unavailable, there
    either is no camera attached to the computer, or some software
    components are missing. Cameras will be listed by their name and
    serial number.

## Advanced mode (Format 7)

The Point Grey interface and nomenclature build on the IIDC (Firewire)
cameras interface. This dc1394 protocol specifies a "Format 7" that
enables advanced features like regions of interest. For use in
Micro-Manager, you almost invariably will want to use Format 7. This is
specified by setting the property "Advanced Mode" in the Hardware
Configuration Wizard to "Yes".

## Binning

Even though some Point Grey cameras support binning, there is no
generalized interface to binning. Often, you can change binning by
changing the "Mode" of the camera. Check the documentation of your
camera to find out what it does in the various modes that it has
available. Make sure to include the "Mode" property in your pixel size
groups.

## Tested with

```
Chameleon3 CM3-U3-31S4M
Flea3 FL3-U3-13S2M-CS
Scorpion CCD SCOR-14SO
Blackfly BFLY-U3-23S6M-C
Grasshopper3 GS3-U3-23S6M-C
```

## Various

-   If you do not find the Point Grey adapter in the list in the
    Hardware Configuration Wizard, please download and install the
    latest nightly build of Micro-Manager.
-   This adapter supports the use of multiple Point Grey cameras. It has
    not been tested on Linux (but likely can be made to work on that
    platform).
-   This adapter only works with the FlyCapture2 interface, i.e. it does
    not work with the Spinnaker interface).
-   In multiple cases, USB3 cameras do not work through a USB3 port. If
    you have unexpected behavior, try connecting your camera to a USB2
    slot (which will have reduced throughput). If throughput is
    important, consult the Point Grey documentation (e.g.
    \[<https://www.ptgrey.com/tan/10359> this document recomending USB3
    components) and if all fails open a support ticket with Point Grey.

## Camera Characterization

Histograms of the per pixel variance of a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 v2
camera and 4 different Point Grey GS3-U3-51S5M-C
cameras.![](/media/Gs3_u3_51s5m_c_variance_hist.png)
The data was acquired at 50Hz in a 512x512 pixel ROI centered on the
camera chip. Median values are 0.84e-^2 for the ORCA-Flash4.0 and
2.6e-^2 for the GS3-U3-51S5M-C cameras.
