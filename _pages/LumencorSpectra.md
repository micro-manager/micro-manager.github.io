To include the Lumencor in a channels group, include the different
colors in the Group and set at least one color to "enable" in each
Preset. Be sure to select the Lumencor as the Core-Shutter. (Do not
include "White" in a channels group that also includes the other colors.
If you do, it will interfere with the other colors. For instance, if you
enable one color but disable white, no colors will shutter.)

If you need hardware triggering for your SpectraX (e.g. to minimise
sample exposure, or for fast acquisition), read this [step-by-step
tutorial](https://github.com/vanNimwegenLab/MiM_NikonTi/blob/master/Docs/NikonTi_hardware_triggering.md)
on controlling multiple light sources with an Arduino for sequenceable
MDA (by Guillaume Witz & Thomas Julou).
