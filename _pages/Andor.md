## Installation

### Andor Driver Pack

To recognize the camera in the Windows Device Manager, install the
latest [Driver
Pack](https://andor.oxinst.com/products/spectrographs-solutions#software).

On the **Select Destination Location** dialog, click browse and choose
the current Micro-Manager installation directory. Then click ***Yes***
to confirm that you do want to install to that folder.

### Disable computer power savings

Disable power saving in the
[BIOS](Personal_computer_setup#BIOS "wikilink"). For Windows Vista and
later, also disable in PCI/e power management and USB suspend saving in
[Power Options](Personal_computer_setup#Power_Options "wikilink").

### (USB only) Finding a dedicated USB bus

High-bandwidth USB cameras like iXon Life and iXon Ultra (Note Ultra and
Life 888 models are USB 3.0, 897 models are USB 2.0)may lose
communication during imaging if they share a USB bus with another high
bandwidth USB device (like the Nikon Ti-E, some USB memory keys, etc).
Plug the camera into it's own [USB bus](#Windows_USB_Bus "wikilink") on
the computer.

## Andor SRRF-Stream

<font style="color: blue; background: yellow"> ***New*** </font> [Andor
SRRF-Stream](Andor_SRRF-Stream "wikilink") for iXon Ultra and Life
models.

## Device Configuration

1.  Open Micromanager.
2.  You will be prompted to load a configuration file. To create a new
    configuration file use "Tools" \> "Hardware Configuration Wizard..."
    to manually add the device.

### Fixing computer bus speed bottlenecks

#### PCIe

iXon PCIe cameras can have their live stream stops after 2 or 3 images
or not start at all. The reason for this is PC motherboards throttle the
PCIe speed depending on the daughter boards populated. Make sure you
plug the PCIe card into a fast enough bus.

For example the Dell XPS desktop 1x PCIe bus will not run at the rated
speed when the PCIe 16x graphics card is populated, so you have to
instead connect the Andor PCIe card to 8x PCIe slot

#### PCI

iXon 885 PCI cameras can have their live stream not start at all, but
will work if you bin the image 2x2 or slow the horizontal clock speed
from 35MHz to 13MHz. The reason for this is a small set of PC
motherboards may not fully comply with the PCI standard bandwidth, so
try another motherboard (or more conveniently another computer)

#### USB

USB cameras using high bandwidth such as the iXon Life and Ultra must be
plugged into the computer to be its own USB bus:

##### Windows USB Bus

You need to use a utility like
[UVCview](http://www.ftdichip.com/Resources/Utilities/media/Usbview.zip) to
inspect the USB bus. Try different USB slot positions on the computer
until the camera is on its own USB bus.

Screenshot below of UVCview on Windows showing the Camera device (in
this example Clara) by itself on the USB bus, i.e. with no other devices
sharing it:
![Good\_Clara\_USB\_Connection\media/_cropped.JPG](media/Good_Clara_USB_Connection_cropped.JPG
"media/Good_Clara_USB_Connection_cropped.JPG")

##### Linux USB Bus

You can easily check USB bus position with **lsusb -t**. The shell
output below shows that the Clara (Vendor 0x136e Product 0x000e) has
been correctly plugged into its own USB bus (Bus\# 1):

## Appendix

### Update Andor library (DLL)

If Micro-Manager's Andor library is too old, adding (i.e. initializing)
your Andor camera in the Hardware configuration wizard can result in:

  - Error code 22
  - Micro-Manager crash (with no error in the CoreLog)

To fix this, update the Andor library used by Micromanager by copying
the library file from the Andor Driver Pack to your Micro-Manager
installation directory:

`   C:\Program Files\Andor Driver Pack 2\atmcd32d.dll`  
`   C:\Program Files\Andor Driver Pack 2\atmcd64d.dll`

### Windows drivers

#### Install PCI/e driver

Make sure there is no yellow question mark next to the device, and that
it is present in the Device Manager.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Device Type</p></th>
<th><p>Appearance in Device Manager</p></th>
</tr>

#### Uninstall PCI/e card to update

1.  Uninstall the existing device driver for the Andor PCI/e
    framegrabber card:
      - The following Microsoft guide explains who to do this, but there
        is no need to physically remove the card as described in step 6
        of the Uninstall section:
          -   
            <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725782.aspx#bkmk_2>
      - When uninstalling, make sure to select `Delete the driver
        software for this device`.
      - Use `Scan for Hardware Changes` Action in the Device Manager as
        described in the guide. If it finds the driver, repeat this
        uninstall process until all copies of the driver are deleted.
2.  Upgrade to Andor camera Driver.
3.  Windows now uses the new `sys` file.
4.  Restart Windows twice. After the first restart you see a yellow
    question mark next to the driver in the Device Manager saying the
    driver failing to load (Code 31). Restarting Windows the second time
    clears this error.

### Description of Device Settings

#### Pre-Amplifier Gain (PAG)

  - It's best to think of Pre-Amplifier Gain as follows:
      -   
        4x = High sensitivity mode (use for EM gain)
        2x = Intermediate sensitivity / capacity mode
        1x = High capacity mode

\<INCLUDE Note text="For EMCCDs, Andor's nomenclature of PAG is
confusing since one may think this "pre-" amplification happens before
EM gain amplification. In reality, EM amplification happens on sensor,
and PAG happens after readout of your sensor and before
digitization.😎"\>

  - PAG multipliers like 1x, 2x, 4x can vary between cameras since they
    are tuned for each sensor, e.g. for a particular camera the values
    could be 1x, 2.4x, 4.9x
  - PAG can affect the saturation limit of your image. To determine the
    expected digital saturation limit, consult your camera performance
    sheet of your camera. Divide the "Saturation Signal per Pixel
    (Electrons/pixel)" by the "CCD Sensitivity (Electrons/A2D count)" to
    get saturation signal in digital counts.

\<INCLUDE MessageBox text="Warning|Always set PAG to maximum "High
sensitivity mode" when using EM gain. Lower settings of PAG is useful in
Life Sciences only in Conventional (non-EM) mode😎"\>

#### Electron Multiplying Gain (EM Gain)

##### EMgain range

  - EMgain does not start at 1 for all cameras. The start level is tuned
    for each EMCCD chip.
  - The actual EM gain range depends on the model of your camera: it can
    be from 0 to 255 (non-linear), 4096 (non-linear), or RealGain 1000
    (linear)

##### EMgain slew rate

{% include MessageBox text="Warning|Typically EM gain levels should not be made to change during an experiment.
The software and camera has no problem in changing the level, but there is a 1-3 second delay for the new gain value to come into effect which affects data." %}

e.g. if you are imaging confocal fluorescence data and DIC, and you need
lower or no EM gain for DIC, one would need a 3 second delay before and
after the DIC image to allow for EM gain to slew. |}

  - iXon, iXon+, Luca-R and Luca-S
  - EM gain circuitry is powered by a high +53V voltage rail and the
    gain applied to the EM readout register is proportional to this
    voltage.
  - Thus when you increase or decrease the EM gain on the camera, you
    have to wait for the voltage slew to stabilize at the new set value.
  - This is typically about 1-2 seconds, the maximum time being from
    setting EM gain from 0 to the maximum value of 1000.
  - Thus it is much better to vary exposure times or excitation signal
    intensity rather than switching EM gain levels in a multi-channel
    acquisition (unless you know what you are doing)

##### iXon Conventional CCD or EM-CCD mode

  - With the exception of the 885, you can switch between CCD and EMCCD
    modes via the Output\_Amplifier setting
  - EMCCD readout without EM gain is more noisy (\~40e read noise) so
    Conventional readout (\~6e read noise) is beneficial if light levels
    do not require EM gain.
  - Benefits of EM gain combating the EMCCD readout register noise of
    \~40e can be seen from 45x onward, i.e it is better to use 45x EM
    gain and upward.

#### iCam

  - Allows for [rapid switching of exposure
    times](http://www.andor.com/software/icam/) in multi-channel
    acquisitions.
  - µManager needs to implement SequenceExposure functions to use this
    feature. No camera DeviceAdapter implements this yet.

#### Cooling

  - iXon cameras MUST be cooled to the specified temperature: at least
    -60 C for DV models and -70 C for DU models.
  - Offset ("Baseline") is optimal at this setting. If the camera is not
    cooled, the offset can be display as 0 data counts.
  - Some blemishes are compensated at the specified temperature setting
    and will be more visible at warmer temperatures.
  - No need to warm up cameras before shutdown of software and computer
    (since condensation does not occur).
  - Full gain will not be achievable without cooling.
  - EMgain is temperature compensated for RealGain cameras.
  - Clara must be cooled to the specified temperature: -45 C with fan,
    -15 C without. The Clara-E is fixed at cooling to -20 C, so no
    action is needed to set its temperature

#### Force Run till Abort

This can be turned on in the Device Property Browser ("On" or "Off";
Default "Off"). The purpose of this is to allower users to acquire
Multi-Dimensional Acquisitions with a large number of Time points.
Selecting "On" will force the acquisition mode into Run till abort. This
prevents the sdk from trying to lock the full size of the acquistion in
memeory (for large number of Time points this is too much memory). The
sdk uses an internal circular buffer to acquire the images.
{% include Note text="When forcing the acquisition mode into Run till abort it is expected that there will be an incorrect number of Fire Pulses generated." %}

#### Frame Transfer (should actually be called "overlap")

Frame transfer refers to the captured image getting transferred to a
masked pixel array storage area (quick step) so it can be read out from
there (slow step). The real benefit of FT comes when overlap is applied,
so that a new image can be captured while the previous is read out. The
confusing thing is that the FT step actually always occurs, whether "FT"
is on or off in uM. That setting only changes whether overlap is on or
off (if off, the sensor is in keep clean mode while the FT chip is read
out). Since the readout register is after the FT chip, the image always
gets transferred to the storage area. So think of the FT setting in uM
as really "overlap."

### Triggering

See details on triggering at Andor:
<http://www.andor.com/learning-academy/trigger-modes-ixon-ultra-and-ixon3-trigger-modes>

(See details on controlling two cameras simultaneously using the
Multi-Camera utility here:
<https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Utilities#Multi-Camera> and below:
<https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Andor#Dual_camera_setup>)

#### Software vs internal

Internal is the basic triggering mode, where the camera decides when to
start the acquisition after receiving a signal from the software. "On
receipt of the Start command from the PC, the camera completes the
current Keep Clean Cycle and then performs sufficient vertical shifts to
ensure that the Image and Storage regions are completely free of charge.
The camera then starts its real exposure." \[iXon manual\] There are no
keep clean cycles between frames when in FT/overlap mode.

Software trigger mode is similar to internal but waits for a specific
software trigger command from the PC before exposure. This is useful
when the timing between exposures isn't exactly known. A keep clean
cycle must still complete before the first trigger.

So Software is for snaps separated by time and Internal is for a
continuous sequence of exposures. For Snap, Software trigger is used by
default. Internal is used for Live and MDA. (All other modes use the
same for Snap and Live/MDA.)
<http://micro-manager.3463995.n2.nabble.com/Multi-D-Acq-External-Trigger-Issues-tp7581206p7581320.html>

#### External vs. Fast External

The only difference is that normal External trigger will not accept an
external trigger signal until the current keep clean cycle ends. Fast
External does not wait and accepts a trigger signal even if the keep
clean cycle hasn't ended. This only applies to the first frame, and once
a trigger signal is accepted, there is no difference in the timing
between the two modes. Because the image area is not cleaned between
trigger events, the effective exposure time is the time between events.

NOTE: There is no readout after the first trigger, so the first frame
should be dark.

With FT/overlap off, External (and Fast External) modes do have a keep
clean cycle after the readout, so the exposure time is determined by the
programmed exposure time, not the time between events. Fast External in
non-FT is only good when the background light is low, otherwise the
background will vary dramatically between frames (if sufficient keep
clean cycles have not finished by the time the next triggering event
occurs).

#### External Start

The trigger starts the sequence. Once the single external trigger has
occurred, the camera switches to internal triggering and acquires the
sequence.

#### External Exposure

The exposure time is determined by the width of the trigger signal
pulse: exposure period starts at the rising edge and stops at the
falling edge.

With FT/overlap on, the rising edge can occur during the readout of the
previous frame. But if the falling edge occurs before the previous
readout is complete, that signal is ignored and the exposure continues
until the next falling edge. This overlap mode requires Global Clear
function of the chip, only on 885 cameras.

With FT/overlap off, the readout must complete before the next rising
edge can start another exposure (?).

#### Snap Image timing mode in uM: Delay for Exposure vs. Wait for Readout

???

#### Recommended settings for iXon Ultras (Use the Multi-Andor control plugin)

##### Continuous high speed imaging with no delay between frames ("burst")

FT/overlap on, main in Software, peripheral in External Start, exposure
time the same

(alternative: FT/overlap on, main in Software, peripheral in External,
exposure of peripheral set to 0)

##### Simultaneous capture but with time-lapse or multiple channels with sufficient delay between frames for readout to occur

FT/overlap off, main in Software, peripheral in Fast External (or
External), exposure time shorter than the triggering interval

### Dual camera setup

The main resource for setting up multiple cameras is discussed on the
[Utility \> Multi-Camera](Utilities#Multi-Camera "wikilink")
DeviceAdapter page. This section supplements that information with
Andor-specific screenshots and instructions.

When you add your Andor camera in the Hardware Configuration Wizard, you
should see a drop-down menu that allows you to select the camera serial
number. If you do not see more than 1 serial number in the drop-down you
should [make sure all your cameras are present in the Device
Manager](#Install_PCI.2Fe_driver "wikilink"). The screenshot below shows
2 iXon USB cameras:

"Screenshot: Device Manager showing 2 iXon Ultra cameras detected.")

Since these cameras are USB, we also have to make sure they are on
separate USB host buses:

USB ports such that they are on separate host
buses.](media/Usbview-2-andor-ultras.png
"Screenshot: Uvcview program showing 2 iXon Ultra cameras connected to USB ports such that they are on separate host buses.")

Start Micro-Manager with a blank configuration and add your first camera
using one serial number:

Wizard (HCW).](media/Hcw-add-andor-camera-1.png
"Screenshot: First Andor camera being added to Hardware Configuration Wizard (HCW).")

Then add the the Andor camera again, making sure to change the serial
number to the other camera in the serial number drop-down:

![Screenshot: Second Andor camera being added to Hardware Configuration
Wizard (HCW).](media/Hcw-add-andor-camera-2.png
"Screenshot: Second Andor camera being added to Hardware Configuration Wizard (HCW).")

Add the Multi-Camera Device Adapter under Utilities so that the final
list looks like this:

![Screenshot: All multi-camera devices added in the Hardware
Configuration Wizard (HCW).](media/Hcw-multi-camera-devices.png
"Screenshot: All multi-camera devices added in the Hardware Configuration Wizard (HCW).")

Complete your configuration in the Wizard then look at the default
Device Properties in your Device/Property Browser. The Multi-Camera
device defaults to "Unknown Camera" so it is not yet usable:

![Screenshot: Default settings of multi-camera device in Device/Property
Browser.](media/Pb-multicam-defaults.png
"Screenshot: Default settings of multi-camera device in Device/Property Browser.")

You need to set these to your 2 Andor cameras:

![Screenshot: Multi-camera device PhysicalCameras set to the Andor
cameras.](media/Pb-multicam-afterset.png
"Screenshot: Multi-camera device PhysicalCameras set to the Andor cameras.")

Set your core-camera to multi-camera, to test the result:

device.](media/Pb-corecam-multicam.png
"Screenshot: Core camera set to Multi-camera device.")

Now when you go live or snap an image you should see the channels
overlayed in your preview window.
