This simple device adapter request from the user a **maximum laser
power** in the Hardware Configuration Wizard. Upon initialization it
checks if the laser is compatible with **current control mode**. If it
is the case, the user can choose between **current control mode** and
**power control mode** using the device property browser. In current
control mode, only the **Current (%)** property will change the output
power of the laser. In power control mode, the output power is changed
through the **Power (mW)** property.

If the laser does not support current control mode, then the only
property available is **Power (mW)** property. Current control is an
option, contact LaserQuantum for more details (current control is
compatible with TTL triggering at least for the gem series).

This device adapter has been tested with Micro-manager &gt;1.4.22 (to
MM2.0.0-gamma) in Windows 7 with a gem561 laser. The API should be
compatible with ventus/opus/axiom lasers.
