The [Thorlabs SC10 shutter
controller](http://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectGroup_ID=927)
operates the Thorlabs SH05 beam shutter. This adapter makes the shutter
usable as a normal shutter in Micro-Manager. On startup, the adapter
will switch the controller to mode=1 operation ("normal" operation").
The adapter has an "OnCommand" property that can be used to send
commands to the controller (see the SC10 documentation). Note that the
above mentioned serial port settings are the default but that they can
be changed through software commands.
