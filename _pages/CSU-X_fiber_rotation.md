title: CSU-X fiber rotation
layout: page
---

The CSU-X confocal scanhead has an APC (i.e. non-flat) fiber connector.
Yokogawa provides a matching fiber with the scanhead. In some cases (for
instances when using the Agilent MLC laser combiner) you may want to use
another fiber. Most APC connectors have the notch in another position
with respect to the tilt of the fiber tip than the fiber provided by
Yokogawa. Luckily you can work around this problem by rotating the
connector at the scanhead itself.

The image below shows the fiber connector:

Unscrew the four screws just around the connector with a 1.5 mm allen
wrench (make sure that you do not loose the screws when they fall out!).
Now rotate the two metal parts (the connector itself and the square part
just behind it). There is also a loose black part behind it that has
many holes and that can rotate as well, however keep it in position. In
my case, I needed to rotate the connector 90 degrees clockwise (i.e. the
notch went from 9 o'clock to 12 o'clock). Tighten all four screws.

Check alignment using a homogenous sample. Here, I used a highlighter
marker pen and scribbled on a coverslip.
