title: Version 2.0 API
layout: page
---

The 2.0 API of Micro-Manager is a substantial departure from previous
versions. With it, we want to provide access to many aspects of the
program that were previously hidden in internal classes. For example, it
is now much more straightforward to access acquisition image data,
control image display windows, read and modify acquisition metadata, and
save data to disk. Additionally, we have rearranged the
`org.micromanager` package. `org.micromanager.api` has been removed;
instead, everything that is *not* part of the API has been moved into
various "internal" packages (like `org.micromanager.internal`,
`org.micromanager.display.internal`, etc.).

The [Javadocs](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/)
should prove useful to anyone wanting to familiarize themselves with the
API. This page provides some more focused and descriptive guidance, with
reference to the Javadocs where appropriate.

## Acquisition data: the data API

The
[org.micromanager.data](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/package-frame.html)
package contains all of the API for reading and manipulating acquisition
data. In particular, there are several new classes that you should
familiarize yourself with if you want to read, modify, or create
acquisition data or metadata.

As a general note, many of the classes (in particular,
[Image](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Image.html),
[Coords](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Coords.html),
[Metadata](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Metadata.html),
and
[SummaryMetadata](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/SummaryMetadata.html))
below are immutable. This means that a given instance of the class
cannot be modified -- it will have methods to read its state, but no
methods to modify them. If you want a modified version of a class,
instead you make a copy that is different in the relevant ways.
Immutability provides many advantages for ensuring coherency of data in
complex workflows. However, it can take some getting used to.

### The Datastore class

[org.micromanager.data.Datastore](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Datastore.html)
is a new class that holds the image data and summary metadata of an
acquisition. Every acquisition has an associated Datastore, and you can
create your own Datastores to perform custom acquisitions (see the
section on the
[DataManager](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/DataManager.html),
below).

The primary functions you will likely be interested in are:

  - \[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Datastore.html#putImage(org.micromanager.data.Image>)
    putImage\] and
    \[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Datastore.html#getImage(org.micromanager.data.Coords>)
    getImage\], which allow you to add and retrieve Images from the
    Datastore (see the `Image` class, below).
  - \[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Datastore.html#save(org.micromanager.data.Datastore.SaveMode,%20java.lang.String>)
    save\], which saves the contents of the Datastore to disk. There's
    also
    \[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Datastore.html#save(org.micromanager.data.Datastore.SaveMode,%20java.awt.Window>)
    a version of the method\] that prompts the user for a directory to
    save to.
  - \[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Datastore.html#registerForEvents(java.lang.Object>)
    registerForEvents\], which allows you to be notified whenever the
    data in the Datastore (i.e. the Images or SummaryMetadata) are
    modified. The Datastore has a
    [com.google.common.eventbus.EventBus](http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/eventbus/EventBus.html)
    that signals events; appropriate methods with the
    [com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe](http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/eventbus/Subscribe.html)
    annotation will be called when the event occurs. For example:

<code>

`import com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe;`  
`import org.micromanager.data.Datastore;`  
`import org.micromanager.data.Image;`  
`import org.micromanager.data.NewImageEvent;`  
`import org.micromanager.Studio;`

`public class MyClass {`  
`   public MyClass(Studio studio) {`  
`      Datastore myDatastore = studio.data().createRAMDatastore();`  
`      myDatastore.registerForEvents(this);`  
`   }`

`   @Subscribe`  
`   public void onNewImage(NewImageEvent event) {`  
`      Image newImage = event.getImage();`  
`      // Examine the newly-added image...`  
`   }`  
`}`

</code>

### The Image class

The
[Image](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Image.html)
class replaces the old `TaggedImage` class as our internal
representation of a single 2D, monochromatic image. Where `TaggedImage`
had a `JSONObject` for all metadata and an `Object` for the image pixel
data, Image has getter methods for:

  - The
    [Metadata](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Metadata.html)
    of the image (see below)
  - The
    [Coords](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Coords.html)
    of the image, which represent its location within the Datastore.
  - The image data itself. As with TaggedImage, this data is available
    as a raw Object (most likely a `byte[]` or `short[]`); however, the
    Image class can also generate an ImgPlus if you are running in Fiji
    and want to make use of the ImgLib image manipulation routines.

In addition there are various methods for creating copies of the `Image`
with different metadata or at different coordinates.

While `Image` is intended to completely supplant `TaggedImage`, the
latter class is not completely gone; it is still generated by various
`MMCore` functions. You can generate an `Image` from a `TaggedImage` by
calling the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/DataManager.html#convertTaggedImage(mmcorej.TaggedImage>)
convertTaggedImage\] method of the `DataManager`, below.

### [Metadata](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Metadata.html) and [SummaryMetadata](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/SummaryMetadata.html)

These classes replace the `JSONObject` that 1.4 used to store image
metadata and acquisition summary metadata. The old system did not
enforce any kind of type safety, tended to have redundant and/or
vaguely-named entries, and was slow. The new classes have pre-defined
supported fields that are strongly-typed, and can be rapidly constructed
based on a template metadata object.

Both of these classes (and the
[Coords](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Coords.html)
and
[DisplaySettings](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplaySettings.html)
classes, discussed later) use a "Builder" pattern to create new
instances. See [Using\_Builders](Using_Builders "wikilink") for more
information.

If you have extra fields that you wish to include in the metadata or
summary metadata, there is a `userData` field with the type of
[PropertyMap](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/PropertyMap.html),
which allows for storing semi-arbitrary key-value pairs. You can add
whatever fields you like to this object. Micro-Manager itself (the
"first-party" code) will not pay any attention to values in that object,
but it will preserve them for any third-party code (plugins and scripts)
that does.

### Coords

A
[Coords](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Coords.html)
is a location in N-dimensional space. It includes an arbitrary list of
axes (represented by strings like "time", "channel", etc.), and a
position along each axis. Every
[Image](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Image.html)
has a Coords denoting its position in the
[Datastore](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Datastore.html),
and every Image's coordinates must be unique. If you attempt to add an
Image to a Datastore whose Coords match those of an image that is
already in the Datastore, then the old image is replaced by the new one.

You are not restricted to the classic 4 axes of channel, time, z slice,
and stage position. You can freely add additional axes and call them
whatever you like. The only axis that Micro-Manager treats specially is
the channel axis, and then only in the display code. Additionally, you
are not required to provide a position along any given axis. If you ask
a Coords what its position is for an axis it does not have, it will
return -1.

However, please note that Micro-Manager's savefile formats do not
support extra axes at this time. Consequently, use of arbitrary axes
must be limited to RAM-based Datastores (created with
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/DataManager.html#createRAMDatastore>()
DataManager.createRAMDatastore\]). In the future we will add support for
saving arbitrary axes to disk.

As with the `Metadata` and `SummaryMetadat` classes, `Coords` are
generated using a builder.

<code>

`Coords.CoordsBuilder builder = mm.data().getCoordsBuilder();`  
`// Convenience functions to set the standard axes`  
`builder.time(4); // 5th timepoint`  
`builder.channel(0); // 1st channel`  
`builder.position("polarization", 2); // Example custom axis`

`Coords coords = builder.build();`  
`int timepoint = coords.getPositionAt(Coords.TIME); // 4`  
`int polarization = coords.getPositionAt("polarization"); // 2`  
`int zSlice = coords.getPositionAt(Coords.Z) // -1`

</code>

### The [DataManager](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/DataManager.html)

Because the API only exposes interfaces (i.e. it does not expose
concrete implementations of classes), you do not have the ability to
directly create new instances of the Datastore, Image, Coords, Metadata,
and SummaryMetadata classes. The DataManager provides that functionality
for you (via e.g.
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/DataManager.html#getCoordsBuilder>()
getCoordsBuilder\],
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/DataManager.html#getMetadataBuilder>()
getMetadataBuilder\], and
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/DataManager.html#getSummaryMetadataBuilder>()
getSummaryMetadataBuilder\]), and also implements some useful utility
methods (like
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/DataManager.html#convertTaggedImage(mmcorej.TaggedImage>)
convertTaggedImage\], mentioned earlier, and
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/DataManager.html#loadData(java.lang.String,%20boolean>)
loadData\] to load data from disk). The DataManager can be accessed via
the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/Studio.html#data>()
Studio.data()\] method, and uses of it are shown in examples above.

## Display controls: the display API

The
[display](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/package-frame.html)
package contains the API for creating, controlling, and manipulating
image display windows. It provides the ability to create new display
windows, programatically control them (including both adjusting the
parameters used to draw the image, and the ability to draw overlays),
and listen to certain events they generate when interacted with.

### DisplayWindow

[DisplayWindow](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayWindow.html)
is the class that all Micro-Manager image display windows implement.
Every DisplayWindow is associated with a single
[Datastore](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Datastore.html),
and displays the images in that store. However, there may be multiple
DisplayWindows for a single Datastore. The DisplayWindow class exposes a
large number of methods for selecting which images are displayed and
controlling how they are displayed. For example, the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayWindow.html#setDisplayedImageTo(org.micromanager.data.Coords>)
setDisplayedImageTo\] method takes a
[Coords](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Coords.html)
object (described above) and changes the displayed image to be the one
at the specified coordinates.

Most of the properties of the display, like the channel colors, contrast
settings, and magnification, are encompassed by the
[DisplaySettings](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplaySettings.html)
object (see below). This object can be accessed with
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayWindow.html#getDisplaySettings>()
getDisplaySettings\] and changed with
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayWindow.html#setDisplaySettings(org.micromanager.display.DisplaySettings>)
setDisplaySettings\].

If you need to perform ImageJ operations on the display, use the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayWindow.html#getImagePlus>()
getImagePlus\] method to retrieve the ImagePlus object used for
displaying images. Some properties of the image, like contrast and
magnification, can potentially be manipulated both through the ImagePlus
and through the DisplaySettings. Where redundancy like this exists, you
should always use the DisplaySettings. Micro-Manager will handle
ensuring that ImageJ's knowledge of the display is accurate, but ImageJ
will not do the same for Micro-Manager; thus changing state via ImageJ
can result in an inconsistent program state.

An important caveat for ImageJ operations: Micro-Manager's DisplayWindow
is not an ImageJ
[ij.gui.StackWindow](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/developer/api/ij/gui/StackWindow.html)
as it was in the 1.x versions. Micro-Manager strives to maintain
backwards compatibility by creating a hidden StackWindow that
transparently redirects most calls to the DisplayWindow; this allows
ImageJ plugins and tools to still largely operate as expected. However,
direct window manipulations (e.g. changing the window size or position),
and possibly other operations, could behave unexpectedly. If you need to
find a DisplayWindow (i.e. you do not have a reference to it handy), use
the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayManager.html#getCurrentWindow>()
DisplayManager.getCurrentWindow\] method or the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayManager.html#getAllImageWindows>()
DisplayManager.getAllImageWindows\] method. If you need to manipulate a
DisplayWindow as a Java window (for example to change its position
onscreen), use the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayWindow.html#getAsWindow>()
DisplayWindow.getAsWindow\] method.

As with
[Datastore](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Datastore.html),
each DisplayWindow has a
[com.google.common.eventbus.EventBus](http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/eventbus/EventBus.html),
whose events you can subscribe to using the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayWindow.html#registerForEvents(java.lang.Object>)
registerForEvents\] method. In particular, you should listen to the
[RequestToCloseEvent](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/RequestToCloseEvent.html)
if you want to be notified when the user clicks on the close button of
the window. DisplayWindows cannot close unless their
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayWindow.html#forceClosed>()
forceClosed\] method is called. If you are not interested in handling
this logic, read about DisplayWindow tracking in the DisplayManager
section, below.

### DisplaySettings

The
[DisplaySettings](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplaySettings.html)
class tracks most aspects of how exactly images are displayed in a
particular
[DisplayWindow](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayWindow.html).
As with the Metadata and SummaryMetadata classes discussed earlier, [it
is constructed with a Builder
pattern](https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Using_Builders).

Whenever the DisplayWindow receives new DisplaySettings (e.g. via the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayWindow.html#setDisplaySettings(org.micromanager.display.DisplaySettings>)
setDisplaySettings\] method), it posts a
[NewDisplaySettingsEvent](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/NewDisplaySettingsEvent.html)
on its
[EventBus](http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/eventbus/EventBus.html).
The various controls in the window listen for this event, and
automatically update themselves to reflect the new settings. Your own
code may also listen for this event if you have controls that need to be
updated to reflect the new state of the display.

### DisplayManager

The
[DisplayManager](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayManager.html)
class (accessible via
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/Studio.html#displays>()
Studio.displays\]) performs various tasks that aren't specific to other
classes in the
[display](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/package-frame.html)
package. In particular, as with
[DataManager](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/DataManager.html)
above, it provides ways to instantiate objects whose constructors are
not exposed in the API:
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayManager.html#createDisplay(org.micromanager.data.Datastore>)
createDisplay\] to create a new
[DisplayWindow](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayWindow.html),
and
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayManager.html#getDisplaySettingsBuilder>()
getDisplaySettingsBuilder\] to generate a new
[DisplaySettingsBuilder](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplaySettings.DisplaySettingsBuilder.html).
It also implements two utility methods to find DisplayWindows:
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayManager.html#getCurrentWindow>()
getCurrentWindow\] to return the topmost DisplayWindow, and
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayManager.html#getAllImageWindows>()
getAllImageWindows\] to return a list of all DisplayWindows.

#### Display Management

In addition to the above, DisplayManager also handles management of
[Datastores](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/Datastore.html).
A "managed" Datastore will be disposed of when all of its DisplayWindows
go away. Additionally, before the last DisplayWindow is allowed to
close, either the Datastore must have saved its data, or the user must
have explicitly confirmed closing without saving.

By default, newly-created Datastores from the
[DataManager](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/data/DataManager.html)'s
Datastore-creation methods are *not* managed; thus, you are responsible
for ensuring that they are saved, if so desired, as well as calling the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayWindow.html#forceClosed>()
forceClosed\] method of windows that are no longer needed. If you want
to transfer this responsibility to Micro-Manager, call the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/display/DisplayManager.html#manage(org.micromanager.data.Datastore>)
manage\] method of DisplayManager. It will automatically find all
DisplayWindows associated with the Datastore, and register on their
EventBuses. All DisplayWindows except the last are allowed to close when
the user clicks the close button. When the last one tries to close, the
DisplayManager will ensure that the user has a chance to save their
data.

All Datastores that Micro-Manager creates for its own purposes (for
example, for storing the results of a multi-dimensional acquisition) are
automatically managed.

## Other API entities

### Album

The
[Album](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/Album.html)
provides access to a "contextual" Datastore that users can use to create
ad-hoc collections of images. This is the store that the "Snap to image"
button adds images to. You can access the Album via the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/Studio.html#album>()
Studio.album\] method.

### CompatibilityInterface

The
[CompatibilityInterface](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/CompatibilityInterface.html)
is where various miscellaneous API methods from 1.4 live. These include
methods for running acquisitions, manipulating the data processing
pipeline, checking the day/night mode, working with the Stage Position
List, etc. Effectively it is a subset of the old ScriptInterface object
from 1.4; however, many methods that used to be in it have been moved
into more specific entities, or removed altogether due to changes in how
2.0 handles data.

You can access the CompatibilityInterface via the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/Studio.html#compat>()
Studio.compat\] method.

### MMCore

The Micro-Manager Core is unchaged compared to 1.4. You can access it
using
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/Studio.html#core>()
Studio.core\].

### EventManager

The
[EventManager](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/events/EventManager.html)
is used to register for various system-wide events, as listed in the
[org.micromanager.events
package](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/events/package-frame.html).
You can access the EventManager via the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/Studio.html#events>()
Studio.events\] method.

### SnapLiveManager

[SnapLiveManager](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/SnapLiveManager.html)
is used for controlling the "Snap" and "Live" components and is thus
important for taking images with the camera(s). It can be accessed via
the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/Studio.html#live>()
Studio.live\] method.

### LogManager

The
[LogManager](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/LogManager.html)
is used to log and display messages, which can be useful for indicating
when important events occur or when something goes wrong. Accessed via
the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/Studio.html#logs>()
Studio.logs\] method.

### UserProfile

The
[UserProfile](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/UserProfile.html)
stores information specific to the current user of the microscope, such
as preferred window positions and remembered form inputs. When the user
starts Micro-Manager, they are prompted to select a profile to use;
relevant information is then pulled from that profile. You can use the
UserProfile to store and retrieve values using a simple key/value
system. Accessed via the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/Studio.html#profile>()
Studio.profile\] method.

### ScriptController

[ScriptController](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/ScriptController.html)
is a small entity for interacting with the BeanShell scripting system.
Access via the
\[<http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc-2.0.0-gamma/mmstudio/org/micromanager/Studio.html#scripter>()
Studio.scripter\] method.
