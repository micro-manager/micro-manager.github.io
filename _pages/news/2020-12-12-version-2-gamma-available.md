Micro-Manager 2.0 is a major step forwards compared to the 1.4 series
that preceded it. The user interface (UI) has been overhauled,
especially with respect to the image display window. The API has also
been completely reworked, allowing for more powerful scripts and
plugins. This was all enabled by a new internal data model for working
with images and image metadata.

Please visit the [Version 2.0](Version_2.0) homepage for more information.
