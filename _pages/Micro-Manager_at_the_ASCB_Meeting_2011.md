**For the fifth year we presented the Micro-Manager software in the
Exhibit Hall at the annual meeting of the American Society for Cell
Biology (ASCB) in Denver. Our goal was to introduce the Micro-Manager
software to new users, gain feedback from current Micro-Manager users,
and to demonstrate new capabilities.**

To demonstrate the software we used a spinning disk confocal system
([Yokogawa](http://www.yokogawa.com/scanner/products/csuX1e.htm)/[Solamere](http://www.solameretech.com/))
equipped with a [Photometrics Evolve
512](http://www.photometrics.com/products/emccdcams/evolve/512.php)
camera, [ASI](http://www.asiimaging.com/) XYZ and piezo Z-stage on the
new [ASI RAMM
Microscope](http://www.asiimaging.com/products/video-microscopes-test-stands-complete-system-solutions/rapid-automated-modular-microscope-ramm-system/),
multi-color laser launch and AOTF
([Solamere](http://www.solameretech.com/)),
[ESImaging](http://www.esimaging.co.uk/products) micro-controller, and
running on a PC computer. All of the equipment was made available to us
by the respective companies (Thanks!). **Please check out slide show
below.**

For fast image acquisition, a triggering mechanism was set-up, resulting
in continuous acquisition at a rate limited only by the exposure and
read-out time of the camera. The camera, AOTF and z-piezo stage were
synchronized in hardware. A TTL pulse, signalling camera exposure, drove
a sequence of output patterns on the
[ESImaing](http://www.esimaging.co.uk/products) micro-controller as well
as the piezo Z controller. In addition, the system used the new ASI
CRISP hardware autofocus, maintaining focus even while running the Slide
Explorer plugin.

Images were taken at 15 second intervals. At each time point, a z-stack of 5 slices (with 2 micron intervals) was acquired. Exposure time was 50 msec, total time to acquire a single time point (10 images) was 500 msec. </font> |

We were very encouraged by the interest and very positive responses both
from the user community and from the industry. On the ASCB exhibit floor
we noted Micro-Manager controlling equipments in the booths of
[Spectral](http://www.spectral.ca/), [Raptor
Photonics](http://www.raptorphotonics.com/search.php), [Axiom
Optics](http://www.axiomoptics.com/index_Events.html), [Sutter
Instrument](http://www.sutter.com/index.html),
[ThorLabs](http://www.thorlabs.us/Navigation.cfm?section=7), and the
[BioBus](http://biobus.org/). Thanks everyone for stopping by at our
booth and for all the support our project is getting from the industry!
A special Thanks to George Peeters
([Solamere](http://www.solameretech.com/)) for all the help in set up
and take down.
