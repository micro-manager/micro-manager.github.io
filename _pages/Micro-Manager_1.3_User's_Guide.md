# Introduction

Imaging cells has become an essential technology in many laboratories
working in the life sciences. The components needed for such image
acquisition consist of a microscope, cameras, light sources, mirrors,
filters mounted in motorized filter wheels, x-y-z stages, and shutters.
In practice, many complicated sequences of motorized operations are
needed to achieve the imaging strategy desired by the researcher (e.g.
acquiring images from multiple wavelengths). Thus, computer control of
image acquisition is an integral part of contemporary microscopy.  
  
From the user's standpoint the whole setup (a microscope equipped with
camera, stage, filter wheels, etc.) should ideally appear as an
integrated, coherent system -- an "appliance." This appliance should
allow for effective and comfortable interactive work, as well as
unattended, completely automated operation.  
  
Available commercial packages more or less provide the needed
functionality for controlling automated microscopes, but, because they
are proprietary and closed, they are difficult to extend and customize.
New devices cannot be added to the system unless the software vendor
chooses to provide appropriate drivers. Sometimes the cost of
configuring the system with all necessary software and drivers can be
quite high.  
  
In contrast to virtually all of the available commercial solutions,
Micro-Manager supports multiple platforms (Windows, Mac and Linux) and
provides an open plugin interface for adding new devices. In addition,
Micro-Manager is compatible with the widely used image processing
package [ImageJ](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/), which is also available
in the public domain. Combined with
[ImageJ](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/), Micro-Manager provides a
full-featured microscope management and image processing package,
comparable in capabilities to commercial solutions. It is distributed
free of charge and under an Open Source license. Its code base and
functionality can be customized, extended and re-used with practically
no restrictions.  
  

# Installation

After you install Micro-Manager according to the instructions for your
platform (below), you can test-drive the software in demo-mode. The
application will start in demo-mode by default after initial
installation. To use Micro-Manager with your microscope you will need to
create a configuration file for the specific hardware components that
are part of your setup.

The configuration process is described in the [Configuration
Guide](Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide "wikilink"). Micro-Manager
includes a number of sample hardware configuration files (with extension
\*.cfg); you will need to create a configuration file specific to your
system, however.

## Installation on Windows

Run the installer (MM\_Setup\_1\_x\_yy.exe) and follow the prompts. The
package includes a copy of ImageJ; it may be necessary to install or
update [Java](http://java.com) on your computer. Besides the
manufacturer's low-level drivers for your camera and possibly other
equipment, no other software is required to fully use Micro-Manager.
Micro-Manager will be installed in C:\\Program Files\\Micro-Manager1.y.

There are no particular hardware or software requirements. However, for
practical use we recommend Windows XP, 1.7 GHz or better processor and
at least 512 MB of RAM. Micro-Manager has been reported to work with
Windows Vista.

## Installation on Mac OS X

Double click on the file Micro-Manager\_Mac(Intel/PPC)\_1\_x\_yy.dmg.
This will open a drive called 'Micro-Manager\_Mac(Intel/PPC)'. The drive
is on the desktop and in every Finder Window. Open the drive (by
double-clicking). In the drive there is a folder called
Micro-Manager1.y. You can install the application by dragging this
folder to your Applications folder, or you can launch the application by
opening the folder and double clicking the 'MM\_ImageJ' icon.

## If you already use ImageJ

Micro-Manager is packaged as an [ImageJ](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/)
plug-in and contains a copy of the entire ImageJ application, together
with the Java run-time environment. Starting Micro-Manager will
automatically start ImageJ as well. If you already use ImageJ and have
it installed on your machine, the original installation will not be
affected. Micro-Manager installs and uses its own copy of ImageJ.
However, if you have any existing ImageJ macros or plugins that you want
to use with Micro-Manager, you will have to copy them manually to the
appropriate sub-folders within the Micro-Manager folder. Migrating your
favorite ImageJ plugins to Micro-Manager installation should not cause
any problems.

## Memory issues with Java/ImageJ

The Micro-Manager installation includes ImageJ and automatically runs
ImageJ on startup. The amount of memory available to Micro-Manager is
the same amount ImageJ allocates in the Java Virtual Machine, i.e. the
available memory is determined by ImageJ. By default ImageJ is very
conservative in allocating RAM: usually it reserves only 256MB of RAM,
depending on the system configuration . This can be a problem when
acquiring large time-lapse or z-stack sequences. In such situations
Micro-Manager interrupts acquisition and warns you that it ran out of
memory.

To increase the amount of memory available to ImageJ and Micro-Manager,
use the ImageJ command <span>**Edit \| Options \| Memory**</span>. You
should enter the amount of RAM equal or less to the amount you have
installed on your system. (For systems with more than 1.2 GB of RAM, we
have noticed that entering values larger than 1.2 GB can cause erratic
behavior on some systems.)

If you have another installation of ImageJ on your computer, keep in
mind that Micro-Manager installs its own copy of ImageJ and that you
need to set memory options on both.

  

# Getting started

On startup Micro-Manager displays a splash screen that allows you to
choose a particular hardware configuration file. If you click OK without
changing anything, the last successfully used configuration file will be
loaded. The Demo configuration (software simulator) will appear as
default the first time you start the application. This configuration can
be used to explore Micro-Manager features, train novice users and as a
reference point for troubleshooting.

Configuring Micro-Manager to work with your specific microscope setup is
a complex topic, covered in detail in [Configuration
Guide](Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide "wikilink"). To make
configuration easier, Micro-Manager includes the Configuration Wizard
utility (<span>**Tools \| Configuration Wizard**</span>) which provides
step-by-step workflow for creating and managing your hardware
configuration. However, we recommend that you try out the Demo
configuration for a while before attempting to set-up and control a real
microscope. All examples in this guide refer to the Demo configuration.

  
![Startup screen](media/Intro.gif "fig:Startup screen")  
Figure 1. Startup screen: selection of the configuration file

  
You can also choose to skip loading a configuration file (delete the
contents of the line in the Splash screen) in which case the application
starts without any devices attached. Devices can then be loaded
"manually" at any time using the Micro-Manager scripting features (see
the [Scripting
section](https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/MMwiki/index.php/Script_Panel_GUI)
of the Micro-Manager wiki). A configuration file can also be loaded at
any time using the menu command <span>**Tools \| Load
Configuration**</span>.  

## The Micro-Manager main control panel

Starting Micro-Manager will also start ImageJ (in fact, ImageJ starts up
first and runs Micro-Manager as a plugin). Both ImageJ and Micro-Manager
have their own menus (on the Mac you will need to click on either window
to display the menu in the main menu bar). Unless specified differently,
menu commands in this manual will refer to the Micro-Manager menu. The
Micro-Manager and ImageJ windows appear differently on different
computer systems; examples from multiple systems are used in this
manual.

![Startup screen](media/Main_panel.gif "fig:Startup screen")  
Figure 2. Main control panel displaying device controls and image
histogram

After the configuration file is loaded, the main control panel displays
the current settings and shows the status of selected devices.

## Snapping single images

To obtain a single image from the camera, press the "Snap" button. A
"Live" window will pop up, displaying the acquired still image. You can
use any of the available ImageJ tools to analyze, save or edit the
image. In addition, at the bottom of the window there are shortcut
buttons to save the image.

![Image acquisition
window](media/Image_window3.jpg "fig:Image acquisition window")  
Figure 3. "Live" window.

Each time you press the Snap button, the image in the "Live" window will
be updated. The Demo camera driver generates a spatial sine wave that
shifts each time you snap a new image. You can also change any of the
settings in the control panel and the changes will be immediate. The
bottom part of the control panel displays a histogram of the image.

## Live image mode

To see a continuously updated, "live" view from the camera, press the
"Live" button. The images will be displayed in the "Live" window.
Pressing this button again, stops live mode. Settings in the control
panel can be changed during live mode and the effects on images in the
"Live" window will be immediate.

## Acquiring a series of images

With the "Acquire" button, you can collect a series of still images
(snaps) in an image series window. The first time you click the
"Acquire" button, a new series window will open, with a fresh image
obtained from the camera. Every time you click the "Acquire" button
thereafter, a new image will be added to the series. Buttons that "Snap
a new image and overwrite" and "Snap and append" are also available in
the series window. Click the "Save" button to write all images in the
series window to disk.

## Histogram, brightness and contrast

A histogram of the current ("Live" window) image's pixel intensities is
alway displayed in the graph in the lower part of the main panel. The
histogram is automatically updated each time a new image is received.
The histogram intensity range can be adjusted, by selecting "camera",
"8bit", "10bit", "12bit", "14bit", or "16bit" scale. Selecting the
"camera" setting will automatically adjust the histogram range to the
hardware bit depth of the image.

Brightness and contrast of the image display can be adjusted by moving
sliders at the bottom of the main panel, under the intensity histogram.
By controlling the lower and upper clipping levels, you are changing the
brightness and contrast of the displayed image. The "Auto-stretch"
option will adjust minimum and maximum settings automatically, based on
the extreme pixel values in the image. Any settings will apply only to
the image display - the actual pixel values will not be affected. Since
Micro-Manager displays images received from the camera in a standard
image window, any ImageJ command can be used to adjust the appearance of
the image, including the standard ImageJ Brightness and Contrast dialog.

## Refresh

The Micro-Manager main panel will not necessarily be updated when a
setting in your microscope changes. This behavior saves resources and
avoids continuous polling of the hardware. To bring Micro-Manager in
sync with the current state of the hardware, use the 'Refresh' button.

## Region of Interest (ROI)

Most of the cameras used for microscopy can be configured to image only
a Region of Interest (ROI) instead of the full frame. To select an ROI
use the rectangle tool (from the ImageJ window) on the image window. By
pressing the "ROI" button while the selection is active, you will apply
the current rectangle to the camera. Some cameras will internally adjust
the rectangle dimensions slightly to fit within specific hardware
constraints. To return to the full frame imaging, press the "Full"
button (right next to the ROI button).

## Zoom

The "Zoom" buttons apply a software zoom to the topmost image window.

## Line profile

The "Profile" button opens up a live line profile window. Unlike the
regular ImageJ "profile" utility, this window will update each time a
new image is displayed in the Live window. The profile is computed from
the currently active line drawn over the image. To draw a line profile a
region, use standard line tool from the ImageJ toolbar.

![Line profile window](media/Profile.jpg "fig:Line profile window")  
Figure 4. Line Profile window.

## Camera Settings

A few settings found in all systems are directly accesible. You can set
the exposure time of your camera, and apply binning ('pooling' of pixels
in both x and y direction). Also, you can change the 'active shutter',
i.e., the shutter that Micro-Manager will open before taking an image
and close once the image is made. This behavior of automatically opening
and closing the shutter can be defeated by unchecking the 'Auto shutter'
checkbox. Doing so will let you open and close the active shutter with a
button in the main control panel.

  

# Controlling devices

## Exploring devices: Device/Property Browser

The main control panel provides control only of a small subset of the
device properties loaded in the system. To view and control all devices
and all settings available in the currently loaded hardware
configuration, use the "Device Browser" (menu command <span>**Tools \|
Device/Property Browser**</span>). The Device Browser displays a list of
all devices and associated "properties" (settings available for each
device). Since this list will often be overwhelmingly long, you can
restrict the list of displayed devices using the checkboxes in the top
left corner of the window. You can inspect and change any setting on any
device. Read-only properties are shown as a line with a dark background.
To change a setting, change it in the 'Value' column and then leave the
field using the 'tab' key or by clicking the mouse elsewhere in the
window.

  
![Device/Property Browser
Window](media/Device_manager.gif "fig:Device/Property Browser Window")  
Figure 5. Device/Property Browser window.

  

## Grouping device properties: Configuration Presets

Obviously, changing individual properties using the Device/Property
Browser quickly becomes cumbersome. Micro-Manager therefore provides a
way to generate 'shortcuts' that let you quickly set groups of device
properties. Setting up these Configuration Presets is an important part
of configuring Micro-Manager and is described in the [Configuration
Guide](Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide "wikilink"). Placing the cursor
over the current preset will display a tool-tip window and show which
devices will be affected by the command. In the example in the
configuration guide, choosing the "DAPI" channel preset command will
move three filter wheels to the appropriate positions.

![Presets Panel](media/Presets.gif "fig:Presets Panel")  
Figure 6. Detail of the main control window: configuration preset.

There is no limit to the number of devices or number of different
properties you can include in one configuration group. You can set
objectives, filters, stage positions, camera parameters in a single
configuration command. The Configuration Presets shown here are just an
example (used in the demo configuration). In some cases, device
properties can show up as a slider, making it easy to set things like
camera gain or temperature.

  

# Recording Images

## Multi-dimensional acquisition

To acquire multi-image stacks, press the "Multi-D Acq." button to open
the Acquisition Control dialog (this dialog can also be reached through
the <span>''' Tools \| Acquisition '''</span> menu entry). Micro-Manager
allows you to create a stack as multi-channel (wavelength coordinate),
multi-frame (time coordinate), multi-slice (Z coordinate), or any
combination of the above. Such stacks will be referred to as "5D image".
In addition, 5D Images can be acquired at multiple positions.  
![Acquisition Dialog](media/Acq_dialog.png "fig:Acquisition Dialog")  
Figure 7. Acquisition control dialog.

After defining channels, slices and frames by using controls in the
dialog, press the "Acquire" button. The acquisition starts immediately
and an [Image Viewer](#image5d-viewer "wikilink") window
will open displaying the progress. During and after acquisition you can
use buttons at the bottom of the Image5D window to play-back the
sequence, browse channels, slices or frames, display metadata or save
the entire image stack to disk.

**Channels** can be selected from the active 'Channel group'. Channel
groups are the Configuration Preset groups that are defined in the main
Micro-Manager control panel. When you switch Channel groups, all
previously defined channels will be erased. You will need to set the
desired exposure time for each channel. You can also set a z-offset for
each channel, which can be useful when the main object in one of the
channels is in a different focal plane from the other channels. Setting
'Skip Frame' to a number other than 0 will cause the acquisition to
'skip' taking an image in that channel (after taking the first image)
for the indicated number of frames. The Image5D Viewer will 'fill in'
these skipped frames with the previous image. In some situations it may
be desirable to acquire certain channels at lower sampling rates, to
reduce photo-toxicity and to save disk space. Clicking inside the
'Color' column will open up a Color selector that lets you select the
color to be used for that channel in the Image5D Viewer. (You can also
change colors later on in the [Image Viewer](#image5d-viewer "wikilink").)

**Z Slices** can either be set as relative to the current position (you
will need to type in the start and end position) or as absolute
positions. Upon selecting absolute positions, the 'Set' buttons will
become active. Clicking these will set the current position to start or
end.

**Acquisition Order** lets you choose between carrying out z-stacks with
each channel (Slices first) or switching channels at each z-position
(Channels first). Multi field mode will take a complete 5D image set at
a position before moving on to the next, wehereas Time lapse mode will
taking images at each position for each time point, in effect acquiring
time lapse sequences at all positions. To do so, acquisition in Time
lapse mode will open Image5D viewers for each position

Checking the **Use XY list** option will cause the acquisition to be
executed at each position defined in the [Position
List](#position-list-dialog "wikilink").
[Autofocus](#autofocus "wikilink") options are
described below. In the acquisition dialog, if the **Save files to
acquisition directory** option is selected, images will be saved to disk
continuously during the acquisition. If this option is not selected,
images are accumulated only in the Image5D window, and once the
acquisition is finished, the image data can be saved to any location on
the disk. However, saving files automatically during acquisition secures
the acquired data against an unexpected computer failure or accidental
closing of image window. When using 'Multi field' mode and autosaving,
the Image5D Viewer for each position will be closed before the viewer
for the next position opens, thus saving memory. Checking the **Display
only last frame** option will only display the last acquired frame in
the Image 5D viewer (all others can be found on disk).

## Burst Mode (Fast Imaging)

Time lapse sequences can be acquired using the [Multi-dimensional
acquisition](#multi-dimensional-acquisition "wikilink") dialog. However,
this causes the software to 'snap' images at each consecutive time
point. Most cameras will not operate at their top speed in this mode, so
if you would like to acquire fast 'streams' of images, you will need to
use the Burst mode, which can be accessed by pressing the "Burst" button
in the main control window.

![Burst Acquisition
Dialog](media/Burst_mode.gif "fig:Burst Acquisition Dialog")  
Figure 7. Burst Mode Acquisition dialog.

Set up the camera (exposure time, binning, etc..) in the main
Micro-Manager window. Specifiy the number of images you would like to
collect. The resulting sequence can either be saved to disk or displayed
in the [Image5D Viewer](#image5d-viewer "wikilink"). When saving to disk
it is possible to acquire sequences larger than the RAM available in
your computer (provided that the images are saved to disk fast enough).
Specify the *' Directory Root*' and **Name Prefix** when saving to disk.
Micro-Manager will automatically add consecutive numbers to the 'Name
Prefix' when the name already exists, so you do not need to change the
Name Prefix between acquisitions. Unchecking the **Display during
acquisition** option can give a slight performance increase. The camera
will report what interval between images it expects to achieve during
acquisition.

The acquisition is performed asynchronously at the specified hardware
speed, using an internal circular buffer to smooth out display and disk
streaming lags. If disk streaming gets too far behind the actual
acquisition rate, the buffer may overflow. The size of the internal
buffer can be specified in the **Tools \| Options menu**. Default size
is relatively modest (25 MB) and can be increased to almost all
available RAM. However, allocating large chunks of the available memory
to the buffer may impair overall performance and limit the size of the
time lapse sequences in other acquisition modes.

## Split View

There are some devices on the market that can split an image into 2 (or
more) wavelength components and project these side by side on a camera
(examples are the [Dual
View](http://www.magbiosystems.com/products/DV2.php) and the
[OptoSplit](http://www.cairn-research.co.uk/Products/Fluorescence/Fluorescence20II20Splitter)).
The SplitMode tool (under the **Tools \| Split View** menu entry) will
display the acquired images as a two channel Image in the Image5D
viewer. You can set the color of each channel and use either a
left-right or top-bottom split.

![Split View Dialog](media/Split_view.gif "fig:Split View Dialog")  
Figure 8. Split View dialog.

  

# Autofocus

Micro-Manager has a single, integrated user interface for hardware- and
software-based autofocus. In the main window, press the **Set autofocus
options** button to open the Autofocus Properties dialog box. Here you
can choose which autofocus mechanism to use among available hardware-
and software-based options. You can then edit the settings for your
chosen autofocus mechanism. The **Duo** autofocus option allows you to
combine two autofocus mechanisms, so that they operate sequentially, one
after the other.

The **Autofocus Now** button on the main window will cause the autofocus
mechanism you have chosen to execute its focusing protocol once.

## Hardware Autofocus

Hardware-based autofocus support is provided for the Nikon Perfect Focus
(PFS), ASI CRIF, Zeiss Definite Focus, and Olympus Z Drift Correction
(ZDC) devices. These devices bounce an infrared reference beam off a
surface of the coverslip, and use this reflection to adjust the focal
position. To activate one of these devices in Micro-Manager, you need to
include it in the Hardware Configuration and select it in the Autofocus
Properties dialog.

## Software Autofocus

Software-based autofocus plugins are also available in the Autofocus
Properties dialog. They should work with any camera and Z-stage. These
autofocus plugins iteratively adjust the focal position and acquire
images to optimize a specific image feature. For example, Pakpoom
Subsoontorn & Hernan Garcia (Caltech) contributed a Java plugin module
("JAF H&P") for auto-focusing based on the relative strength of
gradients in the image (edge 'sharpness'). See
[here](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/MMwiki/index.php/Autofocus_manual)
for further documentation of this autofocus plugin.

## Autofocus in Multi-D Acquisition

The Multi-Dimensional Acquisition window offers integration with the
autofocus system. The **Set autofocus options** button allows you to
choose the autofocus mechanism and configure it. Click the **Use
autofocus** checkbox to activate autofocus in the multi-dimensional
acquisition. You can also specify how many frames (time points) will be
skipped between autofocus events.

# Positioning

## Position List Dialog

The Position List dialog can be reached from the menu (**Tools \| XY
List**), and from the [Multi-dimensional
Acquisition](#multi-dimensional-acquisition "wikilink")
window (button next to 'Use XY list'). The Position List is used to
record the positions of stages in your system. At the bottom of the
dialog is a list of available stage axes, any of which you can select to
use for recording positions.

![Position List Dialog](media/Position_list.png "fig:Position List Dialog")  
Figure 9. Position List dialog.

  
Use the **Mark** button to record the current stage position for all
stages you have selected to use. When a position is selected (as shown
in Figure 9) pressing the **Mark** button will overwrite the selected
position. Positions can be de-selected by clicking on them. You can
revisit a site by selecting the position and pressing the **Go to**
button. The button will update the stage positions shown in the
**Current position** pane. Position lists can be saved (**Save As**
button) and re-used later (**Load**). When saving and re-using position
lists, you should make sure that the coordinate systems of your stages
are reproducible between invocations of the program, possibly using the
**calibrate** button. This will drive all stages to their origin and set
this as the base of their coordinate system. Be extremely careful when
doing so, since it is possible to run your XY stage into one of your
expensive objective lenses!

## Tile Creator

The **Create Grid** button in the Position List Dialog will open the
Tile Creator Dialog. The purpose of this dialog is to quickly create a
position list covering the area of an object (larger than a single
image) in the microscope specimen.

![Tile Creator Dialog](media/Tile_creator.gif "fig:Tile Creator Dialog")  
Figure 10. Tile Creator dialog.

  
Use the **Set** buttons of the Tile Creator Dialog to mark at least two
of the corners of the object that you are interested in. Pressing **OK**
will generate a Position List that covers a bounding box around the
corners that you set. To do this correctly, the dialog needs to know the
correct **Pixel Size**. If your system is
[calibrated](Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide#pixel-size-calibration "wikilink"),
the correct pixel size will appear here automatically; otherwise you
will have to enter the correct number. It is also possible to specify an
**overlap** between the images generated from this position list (to
specify a space between them, use a negative overlap).

## Interactive Stage Movements

It can be cumbersome to exactly position a microscope stage.
Micro-Manager has an option (**Tools \| Mouse Moves Stage**) that might
make this easier. To use this tools, your Micro-Manager configuration
must be
[calibrated](Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide#pixel-size-calibration "wikilink").
When **Mouse Moves Stage** is enabled, double-clicking in the "Live"
window (the window in which the "Snap" and "Live" buttons display
images) will move the stage such that the place you double-clicked will
move to the center. It is possible that the stage moves the wrong
direction. If so, use the camera properties 'TransposeMirrorX',
'TransposeMirrorY', and 'TransposeXY' (accessible in the Device/Property
browser) to achive the correct stage movement (you might want to save
these settings in a 'System-Startup' configuration group). You can also
move the stage by dragging the mouse through the image (a kind of
'Google Earth' effect).  
  
When the "Live" window is open, you can also use the keyboard to move
the stage:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Commands</strong><br />
+x: Right arrow<br />
-x: Left arrow<br />

# Image Viewer, Files and Metadata

## Image5D Viewer

Micro-Manager uses an image viewer derived from Joachim Walter's
[Image5D](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/image5d.html) ImageJ
plugin. The viewer has sliders for both the z and t dimensions, and can
display channels as an overlay.

![5D image window](media/Image_5d.gif "fig:5D image window")  
Figure 11. Acquisition data displayed in the 5D image window.

  
The button on the top left (**Color**) lets you set the color of the
selected channel. The dropdown menu below lets you switch between
**gray** (a single channel displayed in grayscale, switch between
channels using the slider), **color** (similar, but the channel is
displayed in color), and **overlay** (the default: an overlay of visible
channels. Make channels visible/unvisible using the checkboxes, switch
the 'active' channel using the radio buttons). Buttons on the bottom of
the window (left to right): **Save**, **Stop** the currently running
acquisition, **Pause** acquisition, display
**[Metadata](#metadata "wikilink")**, open **Brightness/Contrast** tool
to adjust the currently selected channel, start/stop **Playback** of the
time series. Adjust the Playback speed using the text box (set in
frames/second). The bottom bar will also display the time point at which
the displayed image was taken, the channel and the z-depth.

## Operations on Images

To load previously saved data and open a corresponding Image5D Viewer,
use the **File \| Open Acquisition Data As Image5D** menu command from
the main control panel. Since Image5D is not a data structure native to
ImageJ, some of the ImageJ commands will not work on these images as
expected. To alleviate this problem, Micro-Manager brings a set of
functions that can help working with Image5D images. These can be found
under the **Image5D** menu entry in the main Micro-Manager window. Of
special note is the Volumeviewer, which is Kai Uwe Barthel's [Image
plugin](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/volume-viewer.html) modified
to work directly on the selected Micro-Manager Image5D window.

Note that you do not need the full Micro-Manager installation to open
the Micro-Manager Image5D data. Instead, you can install the
[Micro-Manager ImageJ Reader
plugin](http://micro-manager.org/downloads.php?object=reader) that lets
you open Micro-Manager files in an Image5D viewer and lets execute a
number of operations on these images.

## Metadata

The **Metadata** button at the bottom of the Image5D viewer will bring
up a window displaying all Metadata. Initially, the window shows the
**Comment** tab. This will contain the comments you typed in beforehand
in the Comment field in the [Multi-dimensional
Acquisition](#multi-dimensional-acquisition "wikilink") window. You can
make changes to the Comments here. Pressing the **Save** button will
save your changes to the comments, along with changes you might have
made to Brightness/Contrast of the image (pixel data will not be
changed). The **summary** tab will display a summary of data common to
the acquisition. The **Image** tab displays data sepcific to the frame
(like the channel and time point it was taken). When changing frames,
time points or channels in the Image5D viewer, data in the **Image**
will be updated accordingly. The **State** tab contains all the complete
state of your microscope system at the time the displayed image was
taken.

## Files on Disk

Micro-Manager will store a single Image5D dataset in a single folder.
Acquired images are saved to disk as separate TIFF files, each
containing a single grayscale image. The file naming convention is "img"
prefix followed by frame number, channel name and slice number
(img\_00000000t\_channel\_00z.tif). In addition, the folder will contain
a file named "metadata.txt" that contains the metadata in
[JSON](http://www.json.org/) format.
