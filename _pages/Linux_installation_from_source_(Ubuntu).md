{% include notice icon="info" content="These instructions are for Micro-Manager 1.4 rather than Micro-Manager 2.0 (which uses JDK 8 and has source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager) rather than in a subversion repository).

Intallation notes to install micro-manager from source on Ubuntu
systems. These instructions can also be used without modifications for
installations on [Debian systems](http://debian.org) (tested on Debian
Wheezy and Debian Jessy).

# Preparation

## Install JDK

If you are building the Micro-Manager Java GUI, Java 1.6 or 1.7 is
recommended[1](http://imagej.1557.x6.nabble.com/Java-error-when-compiling-a-plugin-tp5004378p5004386.html).
The simplest way is to use OpenJDK:

{% highlight shell %}
sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk
{% endhighlight %}

(You can also use `openjdk-7-jdk`.)

## Install ImageJ

[Download the Linux version of
ImageJ](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html) from the NIH website.
From a terminal, unzip to `/usr/local/`, and remove the embedded JRE, as
we already have one installed.

{% highlight shell %}
cd ~/Downloads/
sudo unzip ij*-linux*.zip -d /usr/local/
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/ImageJ/jre
sudo chmod a+Xr /usr/local/ImageJ
{% endhighlight %}

## Install Build Programs and Libraries

You will need a subversion client to checkout the source code, several
libraries, and build tools. Install them with:

{% highlight shell %}
sudo apt-get install subversion build-essential autoconf automake libtool \
                     libboost-all-dev zlib1g-dev swig ant
{% endhighlight %}

You may also need to install additional packages (for cameras and
special hardware). See the full list in
[Dependencies](#dependencies)

## Fetch Source Repositories

Create a directory for the the subversion repositories, such as `~/mm`.
Besides the source tree, additional binary dependencies are stored in
the `3rdpartypublic` repository. The build scripts in the source tree
assume `3rdpartypublic` is in the same parent folder level:

{% highlight shell %}
mkdir ~/mm
cd ~/mm
svn co https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/svn/micromanager2/trunk/ micro-manager1.4
svn co https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/svn/3rdpartypublic/
{% endhighlight %}

This creates 2 new folders in the `mm` directory:

        ~/mm/micro-manager1.4
        ~/mm/3rdpartypublic

Subversion (svn) will likely complain saying that it cannot verify the
https certificate. Typing \*\*t\*\* to temporarily trust the certificate
allows to retrieve the repository.

Also, when retrieving large repository (like the 3rdpartypublic/
repository), svn can hung in the middle of the process, with an error
message:

    svn: REPORT de '/svn/3rdpartypublic/!svn/vcc/default': 
    Could not read chunk delimiter: Secure connection truncated (https://valelab4.ucsf.edu)

This can be
[solved](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4031845/svn-resuming-aborted-checkout#13789596)
by typing:

{% highlight shell %}
svn cleanup 3rdpartypublic/
svn update 3rdpartypublic/ # This command might be executed several times
{% endhighlight %}

# Building Micro-Manager

## Create the Autotools files

{% highlight shell %}
cd ~/mm/micro-manager1.4
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-imagej-plugin=/usr/local/ImageJ
{% endhighlight %}

## Download build dependencies

{% highlight shell %}
make fetchdeps   # Required since SVN r14001-r14016
{% endhighlight %}

## Compile

{% highlight shell %}
make
{% endhighlight %}

## Install

{% highlight shell %}
sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

# Post Install

## Editing the startup script

A script named `mmimagej` will have been installed in
`/usr/local/ImageJ`. You might want to edit its contents to pass extra
flags to Java. You may also want to put this script in your `PATH`.

# Running Micro-Manager

Start Micro-Manager by typing:

{% highlight shell %}
/usr/local/ImageJ/mmimagej 2>&1 >/dev/null &
{% endhighlight %}

To view the Core logging in the terminal while Micro-Manager is running,
start simply as:

{% highlight shell %}
/usr/local/ImageJ/mmimagej
{% endhighlight %}
