The Micro-Manager acquisition engine, and the Data Browser plugin, are
both written in the Clojure programming language. You can write your own
Clojure scripts or Micro-Manager plugins using the Clojure Editor
(described [here](https://github.com/arthuredelstein/clooj)), available
under the Plugins menu .

Micro-Manager includes jars for the Clojure Core and Clojure Contrib on
the class path. The [Data Browser source
code](https://valelab.ucsf.edu/trac/micromanager/browser/plugins/DataBrowser/src/org/micromanager/browser)
shows an example of a Micro-Manager plugin in written Clojure.
