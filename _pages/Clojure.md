The Micro-Manager acquisition engine, and the Data Browser plugin, are both written in the Clojure programming language. You can write your own Clojure scripts or Micro-Manager plugins using the Clojure Editor (described [https://github.com/arthuredelstein/clooj here]), available under the Plugins menu .

Micro-Manager includes jars for the Clojure Core and Clojure Contrib on the class path. The [https://valelab.ucsf.edu/trac/micromanager/browser/plugins/DataBrowser/src/org/micromanager/browser Data Browser source code] shows an example of a Micro-Manager plugin in written Clojure.
