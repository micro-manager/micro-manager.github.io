Before configuring for use with Micro-Manager, it's necessary to install
the OlympusIX83 drivers, available for customers from Olympus. The
computer should be connected through firewire to the main controller,
which in turn is connected to the TPC (touch panel controller) as well
as the microscope stand.

Start the Hardware Configuration Wizard, and select microscope \#"0"
(unless more than one IX83 is attached, heaven forfend). All installed
components should be detected automatically. The TPC should then show
control touch buttons to the user, so that each motorized component can
be controlled either from the Micro-Manager GUI or the TPC.

You will need to copy the "OlympusIX3Control" directory into the
Micro-Manager application directory. Micro-Manager needs
"OlympusIX3Control/OlympusIX3Control.exe" to be present.
