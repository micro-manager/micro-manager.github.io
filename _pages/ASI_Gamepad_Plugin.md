## Plugin GUI

### Gamepad Status

![](media/Asi_gamepad_status.jpg
"media/Asi_gamepad_status.jpg")

The controller/gamepad isn't added thru the hardware config wizard,
instead the plugin when launched looks for it. Then it displays the
message “GamePad:NOT Found”,“..FOUND”,“..Connecting” and “..Error
Connecting” accordingly.

A good guide on pairing your xbox Gamepad to PC is
[here](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/accessories/connect-xbox-one-controller-to-pc).

If you already have the gamepad paired, press the HOME button. The
button lights up, blinks a few times and once its connected to the PC it
glows solid. Moments later the plugin will update the status to
“GamePad:Found”

### Save and Load Buttons

The button and joystick assignments aren't automatically saved by the
plugin between session (Note: they are in the 2.0 version of the
plugin), so use these buttons to save and load all thumb stick and
button assignments. Currently, the assignment files saved by 1.4 can be
used in 2.0.

### Axis Assignment Table

![](media/Asi_gamepad_axis_table.jpg
"media/Asi_gamepad_axis_table.jpg")

Axes are analog controls on the gamepad.

  - The Two thumb sticks return a decimal point value between +1 to
    -1.The thumb sticks also have two axis each X and Y.
  - The triggers return a decimal point value between 0 to +1.
  - The DPAD can be read both as a button or axis , it returns a value
    of “-1” when not pressed. “1” when Up is pressed, “3” when right is
    pressed, “5” when down is pressed and “7” when left is pressed.

Using the axis assignment table user can pick a device and device
property that is adjusted when the axis is moved.

A common use of these controls is to move a stage. For this assign the
axis to a stage's vector move property. In the case of an ASI's XYstage
the property “VectorMoveX-VE(mm/s)” and “VectorMoveY-VE(mm/s)” are
appropriate. They accept input in mm/sec and typical max value for the
property is 4-5mm/sec. So here the multiplier column comes handy, when a
multiplier of 3 is picked. Then the thumbstick deflection which varies
from +1 to -1 , turns into +3 to -3 , and when applied to the device
property , the stage will move +3 mm/sec to -3 mm/sec.

### Button Assignment Table

Unlike the axes controls, buttons have only two states, pressed or
unpressed. The Action column of the Button assignment table lets user
pick from a list of predefined actions (like Snap, Live view toggle etc)
or “Run\_Beanshell\_script” to specify a beanshell script to be run on
the button press. The path to the script is specified with the 3rd
column. Clicking on it displays a File Chooser dialog box and user can
navigate and pick the script to run.

A common way to setup the DPAD would be to move a stage on presses. For
this make 4 different beanshell scripts with the following codes
gui.setRelativeXYStagePosition(X\# in um,Y\# in um); each with a
different move and assign them to the DPAD buttons like this:

gui.setRelativeXYStagePosition(1000,0);

gui.setRelativeXYStagePosition(-1000,0);

gui.setRelativeXYStagePosition(0,1000);

gui.setRelativeXYStagePosition(0,-1000);
