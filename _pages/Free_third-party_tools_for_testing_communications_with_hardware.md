## Terminal (serial) communications on Windows and Mac

### Windows

-   Hyperterminal. Hyperterminal is included with Windows XP, but not
    available on Windows 7. We have
    [Instructions](https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/MMwiki/index.php/Windows)
    for configuration of Hyperterminal
-   [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)
    is mainly intended for ssh communication, but can also be used to
    communicate through serial ports. (Works on Windows 7.)
-   [TeraTerm](http://ttssh2.sourceforge.jp/index.html.en) is another
    serial terminal.
-   [Realterm](http://realterm.sourceforge.net/) is designed for testing
    and is therefore good for debugging hardware, particularly if the
    commands are binary (not ASCII).

### Mac

There are several alternatives for a serial terminal on OS X.

-   Use the Terminal app with a utility named
    [screen](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20061109133825654)
    (both of which are supplied with OS X). Here is a Apple Script that
    sets up screen:

```
    tell application "Terminal"
       do script with command "screen /dev/tty.KeySerial1"
       set number of rows of window 1 to 100
       set number of columns of window 1 to 80
       set background color of window 1 to "black"
       set normal text color of window 1 to "green"
       set custom title of window 1 to "SerialOut"
    end tell
```

-   [CoolTerm](http://freeware.the-meiers.org/) This is a free serial
    terminal emulator that works very well.
-   [SyncTERM](http://syncterm.bbsdev.net/) This is another free serial
    terminal emulator that is available for many operating systems.
    However is looks distinctly like a port from DOS, even when running
    on OS X!
-   [PortTerm](http://kulesh-software.com/Software/PortTerm/index.html)
    is an application for communicating with external hardware via a
    serial port under Mac OS X ($20, displays communication in either
    hex or asci, PPC only but will run under Rosetta)

## Device signals analysis

Competent hardware manufacturers provide detailed, complete
documentation on how to programmatically control their devices. In some
cases, when good documentation is not available, it is necessary to
analyze and test signals being sent between a device and the computer,
or between different software components. A number of free tools are
available for this purpose:

-   [**Free Serial Port Monitor**](http://www.serial-port-monitor.com/)
    (Windows) allows you to listen in on all messages sent on COM ports.
-   [**Wireshark**](http://www.wireshark.org/) (Windows, Mac, Linux)
    allows you to monitor traffic on a large variety of communications
    protocols, including TCP/IP and USB.
-   [Snoopy](http://www.wingmanteam.com/usbsnoopy/) monitors USB traffic
    and works amazingly well! Windows only.
-   [**Dependency Walker**](http://www.dependencywalker.com/) (Windows)
    lets you inspect DLLs and other binary code for function names and
    function calls. A similar program is [**Nirsoft DLL Export
    Viewer**](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/dll_export_viewer.html).
