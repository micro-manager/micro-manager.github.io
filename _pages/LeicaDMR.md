This adapter controls Leica DMR microscopes through a direct serial
interface. It was build for and tested with a DMRXA, but likely works
with other DMR models (DMRXE, DMRME, DMRBE, DMRA and DMIRBE) as well.
This adapter does not support DM LA, DM LFSA, DM IRE2, DM RA2, or DM
RXA2.

To use this adapter, connect the microscope using a null modem DB9
serial cable to a serial port connected to your computer. In the
Hardware Configuration Wizard you will need to 'Add' the LeicaDM
Microscope device (and have it use the serial port you just configured).

You will need to define all hardware that is part of your microscope in
the Hardware Configuration Wizard (i.e., Micro-Manager does not query
the microscope itself for devices present).
