'''Installation''': You will need to first install the software supplied by Rapp.  Communication to the UGA-40 is through a serial (COM) port.  Your unit may have included a USB-serial converter, if so, make sure that the driver for that converter is installed.  From your installed version of the Rapp software, copy the files: ''obsROE_Device.dll'', ''ROEobsTools.dll'', and ''msvcr90.dll'' to your Micro-Manager directory.
