Micro-Manager has build-in scripting capabilities. Scripts are written
in [Beanshell](http://www.beanshell.org/), which is an interpreted
language with a syntax very similar to Java.

More recently, the same functionality and more has been exposed through
a Python interface (see
[Pycro-manager](https://github.com/micro-manager/pycro-manager)).

Tutorials for scripting in Beanshell and pycro-manager can be found
[here](https://nicost.github.io/I2K-MM/).

Scripts are edited and run from the ScriptPanel (in the Tools menu):

Scripts (files) can be added to the Script-Button Panel. They can be run
with the 'Run' button or by double-clicking the script name. The latter
method will run the script as it is saved in the filesystem, i.e.,
changes made in the editor will not be run (use the right-most run
button for that purpose). This allows you to edit scripts in an external
editor but still conveniently run them within Micro-Manager.

Single lines of script can be executed in lower right panel, which is an
interactive Beanshell interpreter (a read-evaluate-print loop). The
Beanshell interpreter has a history: use the up and down arrows to
scroll through the executed Beanshell lines.

The editor pane contains an editor with syntax color highlighting and
copy-paste capabilities.

Scripts have access to three Micro-Manager specific objects: the
Micro-Manager Core (mmc), the Micro-Manager GUI (gui), and the
Micro-Manager Acquisition Engine (acq). The [mmc
object](https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc/mmcorej/mmcorej/CMMCore.html)
allows for relatively low level access to Micro-Manager functionality,
whereas the [gui
object](https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc/mmstudio/org/micromanager/api/ScriptInterface.html)
makes it easy to accomplish more complicated tasks. A number of [Example
Beanshell scripts](Example_Beanshell_scripts "wikilink") is available.

An extensive user's guide for Beanshell is [available on the Beanshell
website.](http://beanshell.org/manual/bshmanual.html#Table_of_Contents)

A few additional commands have been added to the Beanshell environment
in Micro-Manager to make scripting more efficient:

      doc(x);     // Get javadocs API for class or object x
      inspect(x); // Look at member methods and fields of object x

A very handy Beanshell function is:

      unset("y"); // Removes the function "y" from the current namespace
