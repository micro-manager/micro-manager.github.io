# Introduction

Imaging cells has become an essential technology in many laboratories
working in the life sciences. The components needed for such image
acquisition consist of a microscope, cameras, light sources, mirrors,
filters mounted in motorized filter wheels, x-y-z stages, and shutters.
In practice, many complicated sequences of motorized operations are
needed to achieve the imaging strategy desired by the researcher (e.g.
acquiring images from multiple wavelengths). Thus, computer control of
image acquisition is an integral part of contemporary microscopy.

From the user's standpoint, the whole setup (a microscope equipped with
camera, stage, filter wheels, etc.) ideally should appear as an
integrated, coherent system -- an "appliance." This appliance should
allow for effective and comfortable interactive work, as well as
unattended, completely automated operation.

Available commercial packages more or less provide the needed
functionality for controlling automated microscopes, but, because they
are proprietary and closed, they are difficult to extend and customize.
New devices cannot be added to the system unless the software vendor
chooses to provide appropriate drivers. Sometimes the cost of
configuring the system with all necessary software and drivers can be
quite high.

In contrast to virtually all of the available commercial solutions,
Micro-Manager supports multiple platforms (Windows, Mac and Linux) and
provides an open plugin interface for adding new devices. In addition,
Micro-Manager is compatible with the widely used image processing
package [ImageJ](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/), which is also available
in the public domain. Combined with
[ImageJ](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/), Micro-Manager provides a
full-featured microscope management and image processing package,
comparable in capabilities to commercial solutions. It is distributed
free of charge and under an Open Source license. Its code base and
functionality can be customized, extended and re-used with practically
no restrictions.

# Installation

After you install Micro-Manager according to the instructions for your
platform (below), you can test-drive the software in demo-mode. The
application will start in demo-mode by default after initial
installation. To use Micro-Manager with your microscope, you will need
to create a configuration file for the hardware components that are part
of your setup.

The configuration process is described in the [Configuration
Guide](Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide "wikilink"). You will need to
create a configuration file specific to your system.

## Installation on Windows

Run the installer (MM\_Setup\_1\_x\_yy.exe) and follow the prompts. The
package includes a copy of ImageJ; it may be necessary to install or
update [Java](http://java.com) on your computer. Besides the
manufacturer's low-level drivers for your camera and possibly other
equipment, no other software is required to fully use Micro-Manager.
Micro-Manager will be installed in C:\\Program Files\\Micro-Manager1.x.

There are no particular hardware or software requirements. However, for
practical use we recommend Windows XP, 1.7 GHz or better processor and
at least 512 MB of RAM. Micro-Manager works on Window 7 running as
either 32-bit or 64-bit. However, some devices will only work using
32-bit drivers. Micro-Manager has also been reported to work with
Windows Vista.

## Installation on Mac OS X

Double click on the file Micro-Manager1.x.yy.dmg. This will open a drive
called 'Micro-Manager'. The drive is on the desktop and in every Finder
Window. Open the drive (by double-clicking). In the drive there is a
folder called Micro-Manager1.x. You can install the application by
dragging this folder to your Applications folder, or you can launch the
application by opening the folder and double clicking the 'ImageJ' icon
(to run a 32-bit version of Micro-Manager) or by clicking the ImageJ64
icon (to run the 64-bit version).

## If you already use ImageJ

Micro-Manager is packaged as an [ImageJ](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/)
plug-in and contains a copy of the entire ImageJ application, together
with the Java run-time environment. Starting Micro-Manager will
automatically start ImageJ as well. If you already use ImageJ and have
it installed on your machine, the original installation will not be
affected. Micro-Manager installs and uses its own copy of ImageJ.
However, if you have any existing ImageJ macros or plugins that you want
to use with Micro-Manager, you will have to copy them manually to the
appropriate sub-folders within the Micro-Manager folder. Migrating your
favorite ImageJ plugins to Micro-Manager installation should not cause
any problems.

## Memory issues with Java/ImageJ

The Micro-Manager installation includes ImageJ and automatically runs
ImageJ on startup. The amount of memory available to Micro-Manager is
the same amount ImageJ allocates in the Java Virtual Machine, i.e. the
available memory is determined by ImageJ. By default ImageJ is very
conservative in allocating RAM: usually it reserves only 256MB of RAM,
depending on the system configuration . This can be a problem when
acquiring large time-lapse or z-stack sequences. In such situations
Micro-Manager interrupts acquisition and warns you that it ran out of
memory.

To increase the amount of memory available to ImageJ and Micro-Manager,
use the ImageJ command <span>**Edit \| Options \| Memory**</span>. You
should enter the amount of RAM equal or less to the amount you have
installed on your system. (For 32-bit systems with more than 1.2 GB of
RAM, we have noticed that entering values larger than 1.2 GB can cause
erratic behavior on some systems, on 64-bit systems you can go higher,
but make sure that some memory is left for the OS.)

If you have another installation of ImageJ on your computer, keep in
mind that Micro-Manager installs its own copy of ImageJ and that you
need to set memory options on both.

  

# Getting started

On startup Micro-Manager displays a splash screen that allows you to
choose a particular hardware configuration file. If you click OK without
changing anything, the last successfully used configuration file will be
loaded. The Demo configuration (software simulator) will appear as
default the first time you start the application. This configuration can
be used to explore Micro-Manager features, train novice users and as a
reference point for troubleshooting.

Configuring Micro-Manager to work with your specific microscope setup is
covered in detail in the [Configuration
Guide](Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide "wikilink"). Micro-Manager has
made configuration easy with, the Configuration Wizard utility
(<span>**Tools \| Hardware Configuration Wizard**</span>), which
provides a step-by-step workflow for creating and managing your hardware
configuration. We recommend that you try out the Demo configuration to
get familiarized with the program. All examples in this guide refer to
the Demo configuration.

  
![Startup screen](media/Intro.gif "fig:Startup screen")  
Figure 1. Startup screen: selection of the configuration file.

  
You can also choose to skip loading a configuration file (select "none"
in the drop-down list) in which case the application starts without any
devices attached. At anytime while using Micro-Manager under the
**Tools** menu you have the options to Load, Reload, Switch and Save
your **Hardware Configuration** files.

## The Micro-Manager Main Window

Starting Micro-Manager will also start ImageJ (in fact, ImageJ starts up
first and runs Micro-Manager as a plugin). Both ImageJ and Micro-Manager
have their own menus (on the Mac you will need to click on either window
to display the menu in the main menu bar). Unless specified differently,
menu commands in this manual will refer to the Micro-Manager menu. The
Micro-Manager and ImageJ windows appear differently on different
computer systems; examples from multiple systems are used in this
manual.

![Startup screen](media/MainControl_window3.png "fig:Startup screen")  
Figure 2. Main Window displaying device controls and image histogram

After the configuration file is loaded, the Main Window displays the
current settings and shows the status of selected devices.

## Snapping single images

To obtain a single image from the camera, press the "Snap" button. A
"Snap" window will pop up, displaying the acquired still image. You can
use any of the available ImageJ tools to analyze, save or edit the
image. In addition, at the bottom of the window there are shortcut
buttons to save the image.

![Image acquisition
window](media/MainWSnap.jpg "fig:Image acquisition window")  
Figure 3. "Snap" window.

Each time you press the Snap button, the image in the "Snap" window will
be updated. The Demo camera driver generates a spatial sine wave that
shifts each time you snap a new image. You can also change any of the
settings in the Main Window and the changes will be immediate. The
bottom part of the Main Window displays a histogram of the image.

## Live image mode

To see a continuously updated, "live" view from the camera, press the
"Live" button. The images will be displayed in the "Live" window.
Pressing this button again, stops live mode. Settings in the Main Window
can be changed during live mode and the effects on images in the "Live"
window will be immediate.

## Acquiring a series of images

With the "Acquire" button, you can collect a series of still images
(snaps) in an image series window. The first time you click the
"Acquire" button, a new series window will open, with a fresh image
obtained from the camera. Every time you click the "Acquire" button
thereafter, a new image will be added to the series. Click the "Save"
button to write all images in the series window to disk.

## Histogram, Brightness and Contrast

![Image acquisition
window](media/Histogram.jpg "fig:Image acquisition window")  
Figure 4. Histogram in Main Window. Brightness and contrast controls are
shown in red and blue.

A histogram of the current ("Snap" window) image's pixel intensities is
displayed in the graph in the lower part of the Main Window. The
histogram is automatically updated each time a new image is received.
The histogram range can be adjusted, by selecting "camera", "8bit",
"10bit", "12bit", "14bit", or "16bit" scale. Selecting the "camera"
setting will automatically adjust the histogram range to the hardware
bit depth of the image. The "Log. hist" checkbox will change the y-axis
of the histogram to a log scale. Some statistical information (min, max,
avg, stdev) about the image is also provided.

The histogram is overlaid with a graph showing the relation between
pixel intensities in the image and display of the image on the screen.
This graph allows manipulation of brightness, contrast and gamma of the
displayed image.

#### Brightness and contrast

The end-points of this graph (black and white triangles, boxed in
**blue** in Figure 4) set the lower and upper clipping levels (i.e.
pixels values lower than the black triangle will appear as black, pixel
values higher than the white triangle will appear as white). The steeper
this line, the higher the contrast: moving the line to the right will
darken the image, while moving it to the left will brighten the image.
The "Full" button sets the lower and upper clipping levels to your
camera's full intensity range. The "Auto" button will adjust the lower
and upper clipping levels automatically, based on the extreme pixel
values in the image. For "Live" imaging you can perform this adjustment
continuously by checking the "Auto-stretch" box; once checked you can
set a percentage of outliers to ignore.

#### Gamma Function

The gamma function allows you to change the relation between pixel value
in the image and display from linear to hyperbolic. This gamma
correction makes it possible to visualize both bright and dark objects
in an image simultaneously, which can be beneficial, especially with
cameras that have higher dynamic range than the display (for further
explanation see the [wikipedia article on gamma
corrections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction). The
adjustments can be made either by inputting a value in the **red** box
shown in Figure 4 or by clicking and dragging the line itself.

#### Displayed vs. Original Image

Since the original image is saved separately from the displayed image,
any adjustments made will apply only to the displayed image - the
original image with the actual pixel values will not be affected. Also,
because Micro-Manager displays images received from the camera in a
standard image window, any ImageJ command can be used to adjust the
appearance of the image, including the standard ImageJ Brightness and
Contrast dialog.

## Refresh

The Micro-Manager main panel will not necessarily be updated when a
setting in your microscope changes. This behavior saves resources and
avoids continuous polling of the hardware. To bring Micro-Manager in
sync with the current state of the hardware, use the 'Refresh' button.

## Region of Interest (ROI)

Most of the cameras used for microscopy can be configured to image only
a Region of Interest (ROI) instead of the full frame. To select an ROI
use the rectangle tool (from the ImageJ window) on the image window. By
pressing the "ROI" button while the selection is active, you will apply
the current rectangle to the camera. Some cameras will internally adjust
the rectangle dimensions slightly to fit within specific hardware
constraints. To return to the full frame imaging, press the "Full"
button (right next to the ROI button).

## Zoom

The "Zoom" buttons apply a software zoom to the topmost image window.
Software zoom here implies zooming in on the captured image.

## Line profile

The "Profile" button opens up a live line profile window. Unlike the
regular ImageJ "profile" utility, this window will update each time a
new image is displayed in the Live window. The profile is computed from
the currently active line drawn over the image. To draw a line, use the
standard line tool from the ImageJ toolbar.

![Line profile window](media/Profile.jpg "fig:Line profile window")  
Figure 5. Line Profile window.

## Camera Settings

A few camera settings found in all systems are directly accessible from
the main window:

-   Exposure Time: You can set the exposure time of your camera.
-   Binning: Apply binning ('pooling' of pixels in both x and y
    direction).
-   Active Shutter: You can change the 'active shutter': that is, the
    shutter that Micro-Manager will open before taking an image and
    close once the image is made.
-   Deactivating Auto Shutter: This behavior of automatically opening
    and closing the shutter can be defeated by unchecking the 'Auto
    shutter' checkbox. Doing so will let you open and close the active
    shutter with the 'Open/Close' button in the Main Window.

# Controlling devices

## Exploring devices: Device/Property Browser

The Main Window provides control of only a small subset of the device
properties loaded in the system. To view and control all devices and all
settings available in the currently loaded hardware configuration, use
the "Device/Property Browser" (available under the Tools menu). The
Device/Property Browser displays a list of all devices and associated
"properties" (settings available for each device). Since this list will
often be overwhelmingly long, you can restrict the list of displayed
devices using the checkboxes in the top left corner of the window. You
can inspect and change any setting on any device. Read-only properties
are shown as a line with a dark background. To change a setting, change
it in the 'Value' column and then leave the field using the 'tab' key or
by clicking the mouse elsewhere in the window.

  
![Device/Property Browser
Window](media/Device_manager.gif "fig:Device/Property Browser Window")  
Figure 6. Device/Property Browser window.

  

## Grouping device properties: Configuration Presets

Obviously, changing individual properties using the Device/Property
Browser quickly becomes cumbersome. Micro-Manager therefore provides a
way to generate 'shortcuts' that let you quickly set groups of device
properties. Setting up these Configuration Presets is an important part
of configuring Micro-Manager and is described in the [Configuration
Guide](Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide "wikilink"). Placing the cursor
over the current preset will display a tool-tip window and show which
devices will be affected by the command. In the example in the
configuration guide, choosing the "DAPI" channel preset command will
move three filter wheels to the appropriate positions.

![Presets Panel](media/Presets.gif "fig:Presets Panel")  
Figure 7. Detail of the main control window: configuration preset.

There is no limit to the number of devices or number of different
properties you can include in one configuration group. You can set
objectives, filters, stage positions, camera parameters in a single
configuration command. The Configuration Presets shown here are just an
example (used in the demo configuration). In some cases, device
properties can show up as a slider, making it easy to set things like
camera gain or temperature.

  

# Recording Images

## Multi-dimensional acquisition

To acquire multi-image stacks, press the "Multi-D Acq." button to open
the Acquisition Control dialog (this dialog can also be reached through
the <span>''' Tools \| Acquisition '''</span> menu entry). Micro-Manager
allows you to create a stack as multi-channel (wavelength coordinate),
multi-frame (time coordinate), multi-slice (Z coordinate),
multi-position (XY coordinate), or any combination of these.  
![Acquisition Dialog](media/MM_multid.jpg "fig:Acquisition Dialog")  
Figure 8. Acquisition control dialog.

After defining channels, slices and frames by using controls in the
dialog, press the "Acquire" button. The acquisition starts immediately
and an [Image Viewer](#5d-image-viewer "wikilink") window
will open displaying the progress. During and after acquisition you can
use controls at the bottom of the 5D-Image window to play-back the
sequence, browse channels, slices, frames, or positions, or save the
entire image stack to disk.

**Channels** can be selected from the active 'Channel group'. Channel
groups are the Configuration Preset groups that are defined in the main
Micro-Manager Main Window. When you switch Channel groups, all
previously defined channels will be erased. You will need to set the
desired exposure time for each channel. You can also set a z-offset for
each channel, which can be useful when the main object in one of the
channels is in a different focal plane from the other channels. Setting
'Skip Frame' to a number other than 0 will cause the acquisition to
'skip' taking an image in that channel (after taking the first image)
for the indicated number of frames. The 5D-Image Viewer will 'fill in'
these skipped frames with the previous image. In some situations it may
be desirable to acquire certain channels at lower sampling rates, to
reduce photo-toxicity and to save disk space. Clicking inside the
'Color' column will open up a Color selector that lets you select the
color to be used for that channel in the 5D-Image Viewer. (You can also
change colors later on in the [Image Viewer](#5d-image-viewer "wikilink").)

**Z Slices** can be set either as relative to the current position (you
will need to type in the start and end position) or as absolute
positions. If absolute positions are selected, the 'Set' buttons will
become active. Clicking these will set the current position to start or
end.

**Acquisition Order** lets you choose between carrying out z-stacks with
each channel (Slices first) or switching channels at each z-position
(Channels first). 'Time first' mode will take a complete sequences of
frames at a single position before moving on to the next, whereas
'Positions first' mode will cycle between all position at each time
point, in effect acquiring time lapse sequences at all positions.

Checking the **Use XY list** option will cause the acquisition to be
executed at each position defined in the [Position
List](#position-list-dialog "wikilink").
[Autofocus](#autofocus "wikilink") options are
described below. If the **Save images** option is selected, images will
be saved to disk continuously during the acquisition. If this option is
not selected, images are accumulated only in the 5D-Image window, and
once the acquisition is finished, image data can be saved to disk.
However, saving files automatically during acquisition secures the
acquired data against an unexpected computer failure or accidental
closing of image window. Even when saving to disk, some of the acquired
images are still kept in memory, facilitating fast playback. If such
behavior is not desired, check the 'Conserve RAM' option (<span>**Tools
\| Options**</span>).

## Fast Time Series Acquisition (Burst)

If you would like to acquire 'bursts' of images as fast as possible,
Micro-Manager's Multi-dimensional Acquisition engine is designed to
intelligently take care of this. You will need to:

-   Set the time interval between frames to zero
-   Deactivate Z Stacks
-   Choose Time First
-   Use no channels or a single chnanel

Thus you will have removed any delay that would get in the way of the
fast acquisition. In previous Micro-Manager versions this was known as
Burst Mode.

## Split View

Split View functionality (compatible with such devices as the DualView
or OptoSplit) is now available as a [plugin](SplitView "wikilink").

# Autofocus

Micro-Manager has a single, integrated user interface for hardware- and
software-based autofocus. In the main window, press the **Set autofocus
options** button to open the Autofocus Properties dialog box. Here you
can choose which autofocus mechanism to use among available hardware-
and software-based options. You can then edit the settings for your
chosen autofocus mechanism. The **Duo** autofocus option allows you to
combine two autofocus mechanisms, so that they operate sequentially, one
after the other.

The **Autofocus Now** button on the Main Window will cause the autofocus
mechanism you have chosen to execute its focusing protocol once.

## Hardware Autofocus

Hardware-based autofocus support is provided for the Nikon Perfect Focus
(PFS), ASI CRIF, Zeiss Definite Focus, and Olympus Z Drift Correction
(ZDC) devices. These devices bounce an infrared reference beam off a
surface of the coverslip, and use this reflection to adjust the focal
position. To activate one of these devices in Micro-Manager, you need to
include it in the Hardware Configuration and select it in the Autofocus
Properties dialog.

## Software Autofocus

Software-based autofocus plugins are also available in the Autofocus
Properties dialog. They should work with any camera and Z-stage. These
autofocus plugins iteratively adjust the focal position and acquire
images to optimize a specific image feature. For example, Pakpoom
Subsoontorn & Hernan Garcia (Caltech) contributed a Java plugin module
("JAF H&P") for auto-focusing based on the relative strength of
gradients in the image (edge 'sharpness'). See
[here](Autofocus_manual "wikilink") for further documentation of this
autofocus plugin.

## Autofocus in Multi-D Acquisition

The Multi-Dimensional Acquisition window offers integration with the
autofocus system. The **Set autofocus options** button allows you to
choose the autofocus mechanism and configure it. Click the **Use
autofocus** checkbox to activate autofocus in the multi-dimensional
acquisition. You can also specify how many frames (time points) will be
skipped between autofocus events. If you have a hardware autofocus, it
will be activated just before image acquisition and then be switched off
again. If you rather have the hardware autofocus switched on
continuously, do not check the autofocus checkbox, but be sure that the
hardware autofocus is switched on before you start the acquisition.

# Positioning

## Position List Dialog

The Position List dialog can be reached from the menu (**Tools \| XY
List**), and from the [Multi-dimensional
Acquisition](#multi-dimensional-acquisition "wikilink")
window (button next to 'Use XY list'). The Position List is used to
record the positions of stages in your system. At the bottom of the
dialog is a list of available stage axes, any of which you can select to
use for recording positions.

![Position List Dialog](media/Position_list.png "fig:Position List Dialog")  
Figure 10. Position List dialog.

  
Use the **Mark** button to record the current stage position for all
stages you have selected to use. When a position is selected the button
will be named **Replace** and pressing the button will overwrite the
selected position. Positions can be de-selected by clicking on them. You
can revisit a site by selecting the position and pressing the **Go to**
button. The button will update the stage positions shown in the
**Current position** pane. You can change the name of each position.
Position lists can be saved (**Save As** button) and re-used later
(**Load**). When saving and re-using position lists, you should make
sure that the coordinate systems of your stages are reproducible between
invocations of the program, possibly using the **calibrate** button.
This will drive all stages to their origin and set this as the base of
their coordinate system. Be extremely careful when doing so, since it is
possible to run your XY stage into one of your expensive objective
lenses!

## Tile Creator

The **Create Grid** button in the Position List Dialog will open the
Tile Creator Dialog. The purpose of this dialog is to quickly create a
position list covering the area of an object (larger than a single
image) in the microscope specimen.

![Tile Creator Dialog](media/Tile_creator.gif "fig:Tile Creator Dialog")  
Figure 11. Tile Creator dialog.

  
Use the **Set** buttons of the Tile Creator Dialog to mark at least two
of the corners of the object that you are interested in. Pressing **OK**
will generate a Position List that covers a bounding box around the
corners that you set. To do this correctly, the dialog needs to know the
correct **Pixel Size**. If your system is
[calibrated](Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide#pixel-size-calibration "wikilink"),
the correct pixel size will appear here automatically; otherwise you
will have to enter the correct number. It is also possible to specify an
**overlap** between the images generated from this position list (to
specify a space between them, use a negative overlap).

## Interactive Stage Movements

It can be cumbersome to exactly position a microscope stage.
Micro-Manager has an option (**Tools \| Mouse Moves Stage**) that might
make this easier. To use this tools, your Micro-Manager configuration
must be
[calibrated](Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide#pixel-size-calibration "wikilink").
When **Mouse Moves Stage** is enabled, double-clicking in the "Live"
window (the window in which the "Snap" and "Live" buttons display
images) will move the stage such that the place you double-clicked will
move to the center. It is possible that the stage moves the wrong
direction. If so, use the camera properties 'TransposeMirrorX',
'TransposeMirrorY', and 'TransposeXY' (accessible in the Device/Property
browser) to achive the correct stage movement (you might want to save
these settings in a 'System-Startup' configuration group). You can also
move the stage by dragging the mouse through the image (a kind of
'Google Earth' effect).  
  
When the "Live" window is open, you can also use the keyboard to move
the stage:

<table>

# 5D-Image Viewer

The 5D Image Viewer is an extension of the ImageJ HyperStack. Therefore,
most ImageJ commands will work as expected on this window.

![5D image window](media/5D-ImageViewer.PNG "fig:5D image window")  
Figure 12. Acquisition data displayed in the 5D image window.  
The viewer has sliders for all the dimensions you choose on the Multi-D
Acq. which include: Channels, Z-slices, XY-Positions and Time points of
the acquired images. You can playback Time Lapse sequences and adjust
the speed using the text box (set in frames/second). The **red** box in
Figure 12 shows where position, time, z-position, and channel for the
current image are displayed. The buttons boxed in **green** allow you to
Stop, Start and Pause during acquisition. Buttons boxed in **blue**
allow you to open the folder in which the original files are located and
also save the current image along with any adjustments to display
brightness and contrast.

## Channels, Metadata, and Comments

While using the 5D-Image Viewer the 'Histogram' section on the Main
Window has three tabs for Channels, Metadata and Comments.

![5D image window](media/5D-ImageViewer2.PNG‎ "fig:5D image window")  
Figure 13. Channels and Metadata tabs for 5D-Image View in Main
Window.  

### Channels

Under the **Channel** tab you are given various options which include:

-   Scale Bar: You can choose to display a scale bar with a set position
    and color.
-   Display Mode:
    -   Composite: Displays image and histogram of all channels at the
        same time. You also have the option to turn off any channel by
        unchecking the box.
    -   Color: Displays a single channel, depending on the position of
        the slider in the viewer.
    -   Grayscale: Displays a grayscale image of a single channel,
        depending on the position of the slider in the viewer.
-   Histogram of Each Channel:
    -   You can choose to make adjustments a each channel as described
        in the [Histogram, Brightness and
        Contrast](Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide "wikilink") section
        above.
    -   The only difference is that "Autostretch" in this case makes
        adjustments to all channels while in composite mode.

### Metadata

In the **Metadata** tab you will find a box of "Acquisition properties",
which lists metadata common to the complete data set. Below are the
"Per-image properties", which lists the complete state of the microscope
system at the time the image was taken. Most of these will be the same
for all images, you can hide these by un-checking the box that says
"Show unchanging properties".

### Comments

The **Comments** tab allows you to comment on the whole acquisition or
an individual image. You can choose the image you would like to comment
on by using the sliders in the 5D-Image Viewer. These comments will be
automatically saved in the metadata and can be used to store your
observations/annotations.

## Files on Disk

Micro-Manager will store a 5D-Image dataset in a single folder. Acquired
images are saved to disk as separate TIFF files, each containing a
single grayscale image. The file naming convention is "img" prefix
followed by frame number, channel name and slice number
(img\_00000000t\_channel\_00z.tif). In addition, the folder will contain
a file named "metadata.txt" that contains the metadata in
[JSON](http://www.json.org/) format.
