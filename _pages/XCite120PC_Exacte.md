The Lumen Dynamics X-Cite® 120PC and *exacte* are computer controlled,
remotely positioned (liquid light guide) light sources for UV/Visible
microscopy applications.

The X-Cite® 120PC Q microscope light source provides rich spectral
fluorescence excitation with a uniformly illuminated field of view, the
convenience of pre-aligned lamps, 2000 hour lamp lifetime along with a
computer controlled shutter and adjustable iris.

The X-Cite® *exacte* microscope light source employs a DC-powered
mercury lamp coupled with Closed-Loop Feedback technology to provide
stable fluorescence illumination, for imaging protocols lasting from
milliseconds to days. With the [X-Cite®
Radiometer](http://www.ldgi-xcite.com/products-radiometer.php) or
[X-Cite® Optical Power Measurement
System](http://www.ldgi-xcite.com/products-xr2100-xp750.php), light
output can also be calibrated in absolute power units (watts), ensuring
truly repeatable fluorescence illumination for imaging experiments.

## Installation

Add the appropriate X-Cite device via the Hardware Configuration Manager

Set serial port timeout to 2000ms

Serial port settings:

-   BaudRate 9600
-   Delay 0
-   Handshaking Off
-   Parity None

### Exacte

When using the Exacte with a Mac download the FTDI drivers for the
USB-Serial adapter
[here](https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/MMwiki/images/4/49/FTDIUSBSerialDriver_v2_2_8.zip)

On windows, ensure that you have installed both the USB and virtual COM
port drivers. To do this, follow these steps:

1.  Open Control Panel on your computer.
2.  Double click the “System” icon. If you do not see the “System” icon,
    change your view to Classic View
3.  Select the “Hardware” tab.
4.  Click the “Device Manager” button.
5.  With the X-Cite exacte plugged into your USB port and turned on…
6.  Verify in the “Universal Serial Bus Controllers” section that you
    see the “X-Cite exacte” listed without a question mark on the icon
    to its left.
7.  Verify in the “Ports (COM & LPT)” section that you see the “X-Cite
    exacte” listed without a question mark on the icon to its left.
8.  If either device has a question mark on the icon, insert your X-Cite
    exacte CD.
9.  Ensure you have administrator privileges, right click on the device
    and select “Update Driver…”.
10. Follow the on-screen prompts.
