**μManager has a simple and clean user interface, through which it lets
you execute common microscope image acquisition tasks such as
time-lapses, multi-channel imaging, z-stacks, and combinations thereof.
μManager works with microscopes from all four major manufacturers
(Leica, Nikon, Olympus and Zeiss), most scientific-grade cameras and
many peripherals (stages, filter wheels, shutters, etc.) used in
microscope imaging (check the [list of supported
hardware](Device_Support "wikilink")).**

### [ HOW IS μMANAGER DIFFERENT?](Why_Micro-Manager%3F "wikilink")

You have a choice of many commercial packages available, too many,
perhaps. Some are produced by microscope or camera manufacturers, others
by third parties but they all suffer from the same problems: lack of
flexibility and limited device support...

### [ IS μMANAGER FOR ME?](Who_should_use_Micro-Manager "wikilink")

With the help of users world-wide μManager has been developed into a
professional Microscopy software able to connect to a huge list of [
devices](Device_Support "wikilink") and effortlessly perform laborious
acquisitions.

### [ HARDWARE DEVICE SUPPORT](Device_Support "wikilink")

Whether you can use μManager right away or not depends on whether your
particular hardware is supported. If not, contact us and express your
desire. [Check the current hardware list.](Device_Support "wikilink")

### [ EXTENDING μMANAGER](Micro-Manager_Programming_Guide "wikilink")

Even if you are not interested in writing software code for your
microscope, the open software architecture of μManager will benefit you.
For instance, μManager's open device interface lets anyone write code to
control microscope-related equipment, resulting a large and growing list
of supported equipment. A scripting interface makes it possible to
accomplish tasks that can not be executed within the GUI. Lastly, the
μManager programming interface can be used from many different
environments (including Matlab) to develop new applications, all using
the same μManager microscope device control.
