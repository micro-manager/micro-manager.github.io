Trying to use arduino to control some leds through micromanager.
Computer science student, doing work study in bio lab. Having some
problems with the firmware version for the arduino with micromanager.
Can't seem to find version 1 of the firmware. Or have micromanager
desire to use version 2 of the firmware.
