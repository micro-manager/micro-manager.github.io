After grad school, I worked at a few startups and just recently came
back to science. Currently, I'm using micromanager to image and control
a custom microfluidic device that allows use to study the activational
dynamics of macrophages. See my linkedin profile
(http://www.linkedin.com/in/carloquinonez) for more details about my
current projects.

Education: Biology BS 1997 from SDSU. Biology PhD 2003 from Caltech.
