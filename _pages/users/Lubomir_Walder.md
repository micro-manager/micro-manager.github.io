I'm a software developer working for Roper Engineering s.r.o, a private
company located in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Our company is a subsidiary
of Roper Industries Ltd. Since 2010 I've been assigned to work for
Photometrics/QImaging, mostly doing new implementations, bugfixing and
support for QCam and PVCAM API.

One of my tasks is to work on the MicroManager PVCAM Adapter, mostly
bugfixing and adding support for new cameras.

The best way to contact me and other colleagues is via the MicroManager
mailing list.
