Chris is a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University studying ion
channel and neurotransmitter transporter trafficking in neurons using
novel fluorescent probes developed in our lab. Prior to joining CMU's
Ph.D. program, Chris received his bachelor's degree from the State
University of New York at Binghamton, during which time he spent a year
studying and conducting research in cell stress at Ã…bo Akademi in Turku,
Finland.

Following undergrad, Chris worked as a technician at Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory studying the mechanisms of prostate cancer progression. It
was here that his love for microscopy was truly incepted, leading him to
later join a lab specializing in fluorescence techniques.

Currently, Chris has inherited custodial duties of his lab's
epifluorescence and TIR-FM microscope which is operated by
micro-manager. It's quite the learning experience. He hopes that the
community can help him learn and improve microscope operation.
