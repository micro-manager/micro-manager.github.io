Software Engineer at Andor Technology. Studied Computing Science at
University of Ulster for which I received a 1st Classification.

Requesting access in order to add information to the Andor Shamrock wiki
page as I had a hand in building it and will be maintaining it. Also
currently working on a plugin for Micro-Manager.
