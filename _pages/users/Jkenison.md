PhD Physicist working in cancer research. Primary fields of interest are
nonlinear and super-resolution microscopy techniques applied to
biological systems. I have hands-on experience in working with optical
setups as well as computational modeling and data processing. My current
projects center on multi color 3 dimensional super resolved imaging of
cells to study cancer progression for better diagnosis and treatment.
