I use MATLAB and a microscope in my day to day work as a scientist. I am
a big fan of the uManager project and believe its open source approach
serves the science community more creatively and effectively than the
software major microscope manufacturers provide. I would like to further
integrate the use of MATLAB and uManager together to take advantage of
the image processing MATLAB provides and the control over the microscope
uManager provides.
