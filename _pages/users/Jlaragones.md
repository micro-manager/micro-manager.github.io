I am a researcher at Universidad Autonoma de Madrid. My group form part
of the Condensed matter physics research center (IFIMAC), and my
laboratory is physically located at the Instituto Nicolas Cabrera. I
studied Chemistry at Universidad Complutense de Madrid, where I did my
PhD under the supervision of Prof. Carlos Vega de las Heras. After
defending my PhD I move to Boston, where I have been a postdoctoral
researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the group of
Prof. Alexander-Katz.
