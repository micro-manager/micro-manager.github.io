I am an undergraduate physics student at the University of Arizona
working in a spintronics lab. I am using the light microscope to map
magnetic domains in magnetic tunneling junction samples. I have been
working with the Wang group at the university for the past half of a
year. I am in my third years as an undergraduate.
