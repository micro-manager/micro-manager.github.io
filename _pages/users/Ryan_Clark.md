I am a Software Developer for [DiCon
Lighting](http://www.diconlighting.com/). [DiCon
Lighting](http://www.diconlighting.com/) is a manufacturer of LED
microscope lighting products.

I was the primary developer of the Micro Manager device adapters for the
DiCon brightfield microscopy illuminator and the fluorescence microscopy
illuminator.

I really have nothing left to say, but my biography needs to be at least
fifty words long. I just want to be able to write documentation for the
DiCon device adapters.

In my spare time I enjoy whitewater rafting. :-)
