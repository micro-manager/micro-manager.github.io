Study in Schweinfurt Ingenieringormatik and have now start to work. I am
young and have a short biography. I like write programms and not
biography. I write C/C++, Java and Android.

Nobody is interestet on my biography. I think it is a field, which
nobody like and shoud not must filled with words.
