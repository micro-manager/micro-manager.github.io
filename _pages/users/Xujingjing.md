I am a graduate student in Peking university.I used to work as a
technician of Imaging Core Facility in National Institute of Biological
Science, Beijing. I have ever used Zeiss Meta 510, Zeiss Pascal, Nikon
A1-R, Perkin Elmer ultraview spinning disk confocal microscopy and
Olymbus two photon microscopy. I will continue study in biological
science at least the following 5 years. Good good study and day day up!
