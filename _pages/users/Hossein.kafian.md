My name is Hosein. I am Ph.D. student at IASBS. I study Optics. Right
now I am working on the Light Sheet Microscopy or maybe you know it by
the name SPIM. I have some experimental experience in the field of
microscopy and spectroscopy. In addition I have some experience on
programing with Matlab and Labview.
