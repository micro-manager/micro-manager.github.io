I am a Ph.D. Student at Carnegie Mellon University. I work at the
Molecular Biosensor and Imaging
Center[1](http://www.mbic.cmu.edu/index.html) in the lab of Dr. Marcel
Bruchez[2](http://www.chem.cmu.edu/groups/bruchez/index.html). My main
interests include photochemistry, microscopy, single molecule
measurements, instrument integration, hardware-software interfacing. I
am primarily here for learning and contributing to Micro-Manager in any
possible way that I can. I can be reached at ssaurabh@andrew.cmu.edu for
any questions.
