University Research Lecture in diabetes research. Currently working at
the OCDEM, Churchill Hospital in Oxford. Mainly use electrophysiology
and optical imaging techniques to investigate pancreatic islet cells
physiology and their secretory mechanisms. The group is funded by
Diabetes UK on a 5 year fellowship (starting from 2015) and John Fell
Fund from the Oxford University Press (from 2016). We are interested in
the cellular Ca2+ dynamics and its interaction with membrane electrical
activity (ion channels).
