I am a quaternary geologist from Mali, West Africa who teaches at
University. I am interesting in fluvial dynamics through the study of
fluvial sediments. That purpose leads me to use very often a microscope
for petrology, pollen and phytoliths analysis. In the study of petrology
of fluvial sediment I am giving emphasis on the heavy mineral fraction
in the sediments.
