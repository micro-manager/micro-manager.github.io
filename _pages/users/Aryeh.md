I am a member of the Faculty of Engineering at Bar Ilan University. I am
using Micro-Manager in my teaching lab, where I try to make use of open
source tools wherever possible. My research focuses on quantitative
microscopy, which means that 1. I have to explain to my collaborators
how to acquire valid data. 2. I have to prevent my collaborators from
ruining the data (eg by contrast stretching) during processing.
