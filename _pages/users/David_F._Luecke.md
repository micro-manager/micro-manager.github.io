I am a microscopist working for the Lyme Disease Research Group, part of
the Cell and Molecular Biology Department of the University of New
Haven. I work mostly with optical and atomic force microscopy. I have a
strong interest in adapting Micro-Manager to our work. Some of my
microscopy work may be seen in our PLoS ONE paper:
