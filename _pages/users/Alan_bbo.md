I have a degree in Optoelectronic engineering and have worked at Laser
2000 UK since 1999 helping Optics, Photonics and Fibre Optic designers
achieve the product goals. I am now also director of Bluebox Optics
working on a range of user friendly and good value LED sources and
related products. I', looking forward to pushing boundaries and offering
people the best products we can.
