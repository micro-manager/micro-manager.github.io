I am a software professional programmer having more than 14 years of
experience in developing software applications for nano technology
industry. I developed a device adapter for AmScope MU series camera to
include in micro-manager code base on Windows platform. I am requesting
this login to provide information to the users on how to configure and
use AmScope cameras from Micro-Manager.
