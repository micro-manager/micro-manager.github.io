I obtained my PhD from UCLA focused on Superresolution Optical
Fluctuation Imaging (SOFI). After graduation, I spent 2 extra years at
UCLA as a Postdoc focused on on compressive sensing reconstructions for
localization based super-resolution microscopy, after which I joined
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and started to work with Lattice
Light Sheet Microscope (LLSM).
