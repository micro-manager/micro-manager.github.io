Currently, I am the Applications Scientist for Image Solutions Ltd, UK.
I have been involved in many types of imaging, over the past 20 years.

By training, I have a Ph.D in Physical Chemistry, and was a post-doc in
Biophysics based in the US.

My current interests are centred around new instrumentation and
development.
