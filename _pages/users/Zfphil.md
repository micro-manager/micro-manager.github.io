I received the B.S. with Highest Honors in Applied Science and
Engineering at UNC Chapel Hill in 2013. While at UNC, I was an
undergraduate researcher in the Optical Coherence Imaging Lab. I then
spent a year as an Associate in Research in the DISP Lab at Duke
University. Since 2014, I have been a graduate student in the Department
of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley, where I
work with Associate Prof. Laura Waller. I earned my M.S. in Applied
Science and Technology from Berkeley in 2016. As part of Laura's group,
I work with fellow graduate students and collaborators to explore new
and novel ways of designing imaging hardware and reconstruction
algorithms together, optimizing for performance, robustness, and cost.

Outside of research, I enjoy surfing, camping, woodworking, running,
kitesurfing, and volunteering.
