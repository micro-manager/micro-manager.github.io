I am a PhD Student in Prof. Paul French's laboratory working on the
development of multiplexed fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of
Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) based imaging. In particular I
am looking at time resolved anisotropy measurements as a method of
combining several FRET sensors Graduated University of Cambridge in
