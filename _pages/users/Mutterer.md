I am a research engineer working for the French CNRS. I'm in charge of a
microscopy facility in a plant biology lab. I develop image processing
workflows in ImageJ for my biologist colleagues. I use MicroManager on
some microscopes, including an Openspim. I develop small microscopy
accessories, usually using Arduinos.
