I have been working as a microscope application engineer in Nikon
Instruments (Shanghai) Co.,Ltd in China Since 2009. Recently, I want to
learn to develop MM plugin for some customized use-cases. I have already
some experiences of programming with ImageJ, which I hope can be of help
in MM programming.
