Currently I am doing research on quantum physics at the Faculty of
Physics, LMU Munich and Max-Planck Institute of Quantum Optics,
Garching, Germany. I came in closer touch with ImageJ and MicroManager
for a project to enable easy and affordable laser beam profiling (the
project is located at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/beamprofiler/> ).
