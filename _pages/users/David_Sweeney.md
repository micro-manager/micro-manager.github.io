I am a software and electronics engineer at Vortran Laser Technology,
Inc in Sacramento, California, USA. We manufacture the Stradus line of
high quality, high precision diode laser modules for use in microscopy,
flow-cytometry, and other various imaging applications. The Stradus
laser may be fully controlled and monitored through the Micro-Manager
plug-in.
