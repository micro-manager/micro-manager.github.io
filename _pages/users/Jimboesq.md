Installing, repairing and training on microscopy systems and spinning
disk confocals for over 10 years.

I'm passionate about the system being as easy to use as possible,
allowing the end users to spend their time on the things that are
important - sample preparation and subsequent study.

I figure it's about time I learned and contributed to the uManager
project - as and when I have the time, I hope to update the wiki for the
devices I am familiar with.

Sadly, I'm not knowledgeable in the area of coding, but I guess there's
no time like the present!
