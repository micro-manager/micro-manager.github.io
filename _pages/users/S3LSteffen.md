Software developer, founder and manager of S3L GmbH (www.s3l.de). S3L is
doing software development in the field of device control, microscopy
and optics. Before that, I have been for 18 years at Carl Zeiss
Microscopy, doing software (e.g. Micro Toolbox) and firmware development
for microscope control. Prior to that, I developed software and hardware
for optical measure techniques: speckle interferometry, vibration
measurement, nondestructive testing...
