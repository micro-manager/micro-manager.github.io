I am a physiologist in the Department of Biochemistry at the Robert C.
Byrd Health Sciences Center at West Virginia University. I am
particularly interested in studying the physiological properties of
organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Currently, I am
combining electrophysiological recordings, fluorescence assays, and
imaging to study the permeability of the ER to small molecules.
