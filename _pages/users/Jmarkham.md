I work in clinical genomics at petermac.org and have background in
various areas - high performance computing, automation and analysis of
live cell microscopy, bioinformatics and physics. For a list of
publications see:

At the moment I'm trying to get micro-manager to drive an old Illumina
sequencer. This has been done for the older Illumina GAIIx but not, to
my knowledge, for the Illumina HiSeq which contains some custom
hardware.
