Currently I am working at the Cell Imaging Unit at the Instituto
Gulbenkian de Ciencias in Oeiras (Portugal)developing a custom made
light sheet microscopy (SPIM/DSLM).

Previously I have been working on the development of microscopy
techniques, mainly Two-Photon microscopy (TPEF), Second and Third
Harmonic microscopy (SHG/THG), Stimulated Emission Depletion
microscopy(STED) at ICFO (Castelldefels, Spain), IESL-FORTH(Heraklion,
Greece) and LOUM (Murcia, Spain).
