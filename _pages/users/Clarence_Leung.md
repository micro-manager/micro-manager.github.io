I am a current B.Sc. Computer Science and Biology undergraduate at
McGill University, volunteering as a member of the microscopy lab under
Professor Sabrina Leslie. We currently work on developing devices for
CLIC (convex lens-induced confinement) microscopy experiments for
measuring confined single-molecule interactions.

On the Micro-Manager project, I am currently working on developing
device adapters for the Standa series of devices.
