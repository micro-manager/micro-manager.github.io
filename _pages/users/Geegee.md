I studied physics at Ulm University and did my masters degree at the
interface of classical NMR and quantum physics, which focuses on
magnotometry on the nano scale. For this we used a confocal microscope
with our homebuilt software QuDi. See here:
<https://github.com/Ulm-IQO/qudi>

I continue on this work now by doing a PhD in Ulm in a new project,
where we focus on the micro meter scale which is interesting for cell
detection or small bacteria. For this we want use a EMCCD camera, which
would be nice to include it in QuDi.
