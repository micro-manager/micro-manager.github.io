I am just a person who has a general interest in doing cell imaging,
with no science background or imaging backgroun, but finnd your platform
easy to use. I have been to the NIH web site, they have invaluable
sourses to do imaging, and along with many othe web-links as well.

Thank you, John Mattocks
