I've graduated McGill University, Montreal,Canada. My specialization was
microscopy and image analysis of biological objects. Currently, I'm
working in the Computer Science Department of McGill as a research
associate in a project involving image acquisition. I'd like to set up
the system that will be compatible with Micro-Manager in order to have a
flexibility in a future and being able to customize this software for
different types of microscopy...
