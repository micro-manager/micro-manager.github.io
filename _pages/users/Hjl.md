I work for Professor Rob Phillips at the California Institute of
Technology. I am a staff scientist who specializes in optics and
microscopy. I have taught optics and microscopy at Caltech, the Gwang-Ju
Institute of Science and Technology (GIST Korea), and the Physiology
course at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woodshole, MA. I have been
in optics for over 20 years.
