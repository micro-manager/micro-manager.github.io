My research is focused at mechanobiology of cell adhesion. I'm working
on various customized microscopes and developing the biophysical/optical
assay to address my questions. Currently a senior postdoc at IMCB,
Singapore, I'll work as a microscope manager in Natl Yang-Ming Univ,
Taipei, Taiwan this year. It'd be interesting for me to test this
open-access software.
