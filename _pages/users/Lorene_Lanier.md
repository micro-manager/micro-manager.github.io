We are interested in understanding the fundamental process that
determine when, where and how neurons make connections. Forming
connections depends on the ability of axons and dendrites to extend into
the surrounding tissue. This navigation is accomplished by the growth
cone, a highly dynamic structure at the end of developing axons and
dendrites. Interestingly, formation of a growth cone is also a key step
in neuronal regeneration after injury, suggesting that regeneration may
involve recapitulation of some aspects of neuronal development. In the
Lanier lab, we are using primary neuronal cultures and a combination of
molecular biology, biochemistry, live cell imaging and fluorescent and
electron microscopy to identify key components of the growth cone
machinery. This information can then be used to develop transgenic mouse
models to study growth cone motility and guidance in vivo.
