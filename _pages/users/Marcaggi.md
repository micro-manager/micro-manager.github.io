Païkan Marcaggi investigates real time nerve cell interactions, using
quantitative approaches. In the course of his research with J.A. Coles
(PhD) and with D. Attwell (postdoc) on the role of ammonium and
glutamate transporters, he gradually focused his interest on
glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity mechanisms. In 2006,
he was awarded an MRC Career Development Fellowship and set up an
independent lab at University College London. As a principal
investigator, he investigated properties of metabotropic glutamate
receptors, endocannabinoid signaling and synaptic plasticity in the
cerebellum. He was appointed a CNRS researcher at the ENS, Paris, where
he worked with S. Dieudonné on cerebellar physiology using optogenetic
and two-photon microscopy. He joined the INMED in October 2014.
