I'm developing image acquisition, processing & analysis microscopy
protocols (lightfield and LSCM) for clinical microbiology and pathology
departments. Interested in video acquisition. Programmer, linux user.

At this moment I'm trying to build an realtime image analysis software,
based on Micromanager and some python image processing libraries.
