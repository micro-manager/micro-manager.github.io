I am an engineering scientist based in Ballina, New South Wales,
Australia (around 100 miles south of Brisbane) working on a Phase
Contrast Microscope project. My particular interest is in measuring
'grey levels' of Phase Contrast images, preferably live, so as to
optimise focus of nearly invisible phase objects for photography.
Otherwise, automatic measurement of grey levels and of the difference
between maximum and minimum on recorded images would be a reasonable
compromise.
