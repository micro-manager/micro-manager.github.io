Research assistant at University of Southern Denmark, MEMPHYS.
Developing software for image analysis obtained by flicker imaging. In
addition I do a lot of modelling and theoretical work, mainly on
biophysics and membranes. For other relevant projects I work with
developing a new technique to measure entropy production using Atomic
Force Microscopy.
