I am a graduate student from School of Life Science, Peking University,
China. From April 2009 to present, I worked in a zebrafish laboratory
with the interests in the molecular and cellular mechanisms of
hematopoietic and cardiovascular development using genetic tools. My
works focus on studying the mechanism behind heart and fin regeneration
in zebrafish.
