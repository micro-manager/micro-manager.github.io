Post doctoral research associate at Imperial College London. Primarily
interested in single molecule imaging, cell signalling and drug
discovery. I have recently started developing a liquid handling robot to
fit over a microscope, controlled by micro manager to do
immunofluorescence for drug discovery. I have knowledge of the ImageJ
macro language, started beanshell and now a little python, C++ and Java.
