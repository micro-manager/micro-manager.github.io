I am a PhD student in University of Texas at Austin. Before PhD , during
my master studies, I was working on MOEMS desing. I am now using
micromanager and MATLAB to communicate with the coolsnap camera. My
research is mainly on control systems. I want to exchange information
and get used to micromanager throughout sharing information.
