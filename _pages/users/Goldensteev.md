I graduated in 2016 from the University of Pierre and Marie Curie (Paris
6) with a Masters Degree in Bioinformatics and modeling
(http://www.upmc.fr/en/education/diplomas/sciences\_and\_technologies/masters/master\_of\_molecular\_and\_cellular\_biology/bioinformatics\_and\_modeling\_specialization\_m2.html).

Early 2017 i was then hired as an Engineer at InBio, a new INRIA/Pasteur
Institute unit
(https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/experimental-and-computational-methods-for-modeling-cellular-processes/)
to work on Microscopy Automation involving Micromanager among other
things.
