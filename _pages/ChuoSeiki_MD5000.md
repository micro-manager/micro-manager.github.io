The <b>MD5000 series controllers</b> use a virtual serial port via the
USB interface. You have to install the MD5000 USB driver before using.
You can also install the MD51\_52OPTOOL to customize some parameters
that can not be changed in Micro-Manager (such as acceleration time,
motor current, sensor settings, home-search settings, etc.).

Please click here
[1](media/MD5000USBdriver.zip) to download
the <b>MD5000 USB driver</b> and here
[2](media/MD51_52OPTOOL.zip) for the
<b>MD51\_52OPTOOL</b> software.

To download the <b>MD5000 user manual</b>, please follow this link

The <b>ChuoSeiki MD5000</b> device adapter can control one or more
MD-controllers. You can register multi adapters in <em>Hardware
Configuration Wizard</em> with different serial ports (USB-virtual), and
each device adapter drives one controller via one serial port.

The Serial port settings are as following:

**Serial port settings**

|                     |        |      |
|---------------------|--------|------|
| Baudrate            | 115200 | bps  |
| DataBits            | 8      | bits |
| StopBits            | 1      | bit  |
| ParityBits          | None   | bit  |
| AnswerTimeout       | 500    | ms   |
| DelayBetweenCharsMs | 0.00   | ms   |
| Handshaking         | OFF    |      |

|                      |      |        |
|----------------------|------|--------|
| Speed                | 1000 | pps    |
| StepSize             | 1    | um     |
| Acceleration pattern | "1"  | (0 ms) |

<em>Please customize your stage settings using <em>Group</em> and
<em>Preset settings</em> in Micro-Manager. Or you can load the setting
from a saved .cfg file.</em>

{% include Note text="'''Axis Name Registration'''" %}

The "ChuoSeiki MD 2-Axis\|\|XY stages" supports only the 2-axis
controller (MD5230D). In this device adapter, the 2 stages names are
defined as "X" and "Y", respectively. It uses some functions that work
only on MD5230D controller.

The "ChuoSeiki MD 1-Axis\|\|Z stage" supports the 1-axis controller
(MD5130D) or controls 1 channel of the MD5230D. The axis name can be
defined when initializing the device adapter. For MD5130D, the axis name
must be set as default ("X"). For MD5230D, the axis name can be defined
as "X" or "Y", depends on which channel is connected to the Z-stage.

{% include Note text="'''Acceleration Pattern'''" %}

In Device adapter, the Acceleration pattern (include acceleration and
deceleration times) can be changed from "1", "2", "3" and "4". They
correspond to the 4 acceleration times that are registered in Controller
speed settings 1,2,3 and 4, respectively. To use a customized
acceleration time, please change and register using MD51\_52OPTOOL
software.

Default Acceleration pattern:

|         |                   |                   |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Pattern | Acceleration time | Deceleration time |
| "1"     | 0 (ms)            | 0 (ms)            |
| "2"     | 500 (ms)          | 0 (ms)            |
| "3"     | 500 (ms)          | 0 (ms)            |
| "4"     | 500 (ms)          | 0 (ms)            |

{% include Note text="'''Step Resolution'''" %}

The default step resolution registered in MD51\_52OPTOOL is 20 um,
please change this parameter in the first use.

The Step resolution (step zise) can be initialized to the controller
using MD51\_52OPTOOL or be registered in Micro-Manager. Therefore, be
carefull with the interpolation error if the step resolution is
registered two times.
