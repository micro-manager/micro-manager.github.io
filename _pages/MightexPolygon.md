(Documentation to be written.)

You will need to copy MT_POLYGON400_IMGC.DLL and MT_Polygon400_SDK.DLL from your MightEx folder into ÂµManager's folder in order for the device adapter to load. In the Mightex folder there is also a folder MT_Polygon400_SDK/, and in there one (or more) subfolders with names similar to DSIGeeeeeeeeeeeeLAP1014103100/. You will need to copy the entire MT_Polygon400_SDK/ folder to the root of the micromanager folder as well.

Note: For some weird reason, on Windows the device will show up in the Device Manager as some sort of network controller.
