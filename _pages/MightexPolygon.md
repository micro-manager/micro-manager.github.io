Plugin](Mightex_Polygon_Plugin "wikilink").)

(Documentation to be written.)

You will need to copy MT\_POLYGON400\_IMGC.DLL and
MT\_Polygon400\_SDK.DLL from your MightEx folder into ÂµManager's folder
in order for the device adapter to load. In the Mightex folder there is
also a folder MT\_Polygon400\_SDK/, and in there one (or more)
subfolders with names similar to DSIGeeeeeeeeeeeeLAP1014103100/. You
will need to copy the entire MT\_Polygon400\_SDK/ folder to the root of
the micromanager folder as well.

Note: For some weird reason, on Windows the device will show up in the
Device Manager as some sort of network controller.

See [this
thread](http://micro-manager.3463995.n2.nabble.com/MightEx-Polygon-device-can-t-install-td7585963.html#a7585978).
