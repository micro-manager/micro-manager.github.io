Plugin](Mightex_Polygon_Plugin "wikilink").)

(Documentation to be written.)

You will need to copy `MT\_POLYGON400\_IMGC.DLL` and
`MT\_Polygon400\_SDK.DLL` from your MightEx folder into ÂµManager's folder
in order for the device adapter to load. In the Mightex folder there is
also a folder `MT\_Polygon400\_SDK/`, and in there one (or more)
subfolders with names similar to `DSIGeeeeeeeeeeeeLAP1014103100/`. You
will need to copy the entire `MT\_Polygon400\_SDK/` folder to the root of
the micromanager folder as well.

Note: For some weird reason, on Windows the device will show up in the
Device Manager as some sort of network controller.

See [this
thread](http://micro-manager.3463995.n2.nabble.com/MightEx-Polygon-device-can-t-install-td7585963.html#a7585978).

Notes for Polygon1000:

  - After installation, the device could not be found by PolyScan2
    (application provided by Mightex). The device showed up as
    "libus-win32 device" - "Unprogrammed Cypress FX3". It showed up as
    something Andor related (I have the feeling that Mightex and Andor
    used the same USB VID/PID, causing these issues). Clicking on
    "Update driver", and locating the driver `(Tools \> Drivers \>
    Polygon1000 \> Win10\_x64)` resulted in a workable driver (shows up
    as `Universal Serial Bus Controllers \> Cypress FX3 StreamerExample
    Device`. THis device is recognized by PolyScan2.
  - Copied `MT\_Polygon400\_SDK` from the provided USB drive into the
    Micro-Manager application directory.
  - Copied `mt\_polygon1000\_sdd.dll`, `MT\_Polygon1000\_SDK.dll`,
    `Mightex\_BLSDriver\_SDK.dll`, and the Polygon did not appear in the
    HCW. After copying `MT\_Polygon400\_IMGC.dll` and
    `MT\_Polgon400\_SDK.dll` into the Micro-Manager directory, it did
    appear. However, after selecting it the application reports: "Error
    in device "MightexPolygon": Unable to communicate with the device.
    (35).

Stuck for now...
