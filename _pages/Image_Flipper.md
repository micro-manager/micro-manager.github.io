The image flipper plugin lets you rotate and/or mirror images acquired
by the camera.

![](media/ImageFlipper.png "media/ImageFlipper.png")

Select the camera that the image transformation should apply to in the
top-most dropdown menu. Use the "Mirror" checkbox and "Rotate" dropdown
menu to specify the desired transformation (look at the image of the
letter "R" to make sure you get what you need). All subsequent images
acquired by this camera will be transformed as specified.

Note that this plugin can be especially useful in combination with the
[Multi-Camera device](Utilities#Multi-Camera "wikilink"), in cases where
one of the two cameras used provides a mirrored image.
