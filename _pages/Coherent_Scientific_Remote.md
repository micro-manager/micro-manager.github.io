This device adapter was written for the Coherent Obis Scientific Remote
Laser Controller. Compatibility was also tested with the Coherent Obis
Single Remote.  
Inside MicroManager, for each connected laser, the following
'properties' are available with this device adapter:

-   Laser Power (%) *(Read/Write)*
-   Laser State (On/Off) *(Read/Write)*
-   Modulation/Trigger (CW, Digital, Analog) *(Read/Write)*
-   Head Usage (h) *(Read only)*
-   Wavelength (nm) *(Read only)*
-   Minimum Laser Power (mW) *(Read only)*
-   Maximum Laser Power (mW) *(Read only)*
-   Power Readback (mW) *(Read only)*
-   Laser Port *(Read Only)*
-   Temperature Baseplate (Â°C) *(Read only)*

In addition any laser can be selected for being shuttered software-wise
while acquiring an image.
