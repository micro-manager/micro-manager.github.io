# FrameCombiner

A [Micro-Manager 2](https://micro-manager.org/) plugin that can process
stack images in time. The processing can be applied in real-time (live
mode) or during an acquisition (MDA).

This plugin was inspired by the excellent FrameAverager plugin from
[OpenPolScope](http://www.openpolscope.org/pages/MMPlugin_Frame_Averager.htm)
available on github at
<https://github.com/LC-PolScope/Micro-Manager-Addons>.

The motivation to create this plugin was to make it compatible with
Micro-Manager 2 and also add more processing operations. This plugin is
not compatible with earlier versions of Micro-Manager.

# Usage

-   Launch Micro-manager.
-   Execute the plugin with Plugin ▶ On-The-Fly Image Processing ▶ Frame
    Processor.
-   Launch a live or MDA acquisition.
-   Set the number of frames you want to process and the algorithm you
    want to apply on the stack such as mean, max, min, or sum.
-   The acquisition window displays the processed images (mean image of
    the last 10 images by default).

Please report any issue to
<https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager/issues>.

# Features

-   This plugin can perform several classic operations during **live**
    or **MDA** such as `mean`, `sum`, `max` and `min` on a
    user-specified number of frames.
-   Images are processed for each combinations of Z, Channel and Stage
    Position.
-   User can choose a set of channels to be ignored by the processor.
