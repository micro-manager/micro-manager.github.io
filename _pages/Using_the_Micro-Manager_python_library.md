The easiest way to control Micro-Manager through Python is the [https://github.com/micro-manager/pycro-manager Pycro-manager] library. 

The instructions below are for an alternative mechanism in which you compile the micro-manager core yourself with python bindings.


'''MMCorePy''' is a wrapper that allows you to control microscope hardware from python interactive session or script. It's support Windows, Mac and Linux.

Micromanager's main parts:
* CMMCore - basic module, written in C++. Script languages like python just wrap it by [http://www.swig.org swig].
* Device adapters - various libraries that allow support for various hardware. If you want to built one and extend MM devise support, follow [[Building Micro-Manager Device Adapters|this guide]].
* MMCorePy - python wrapper. MM build scripts are support both python 2 and 3, but windows version still ships with python 2 bindings only.
* MMCoreJ - java wrapper
* MMStudio - Micromanager GUI (technically it is ImageJ plugin).

== Environment setup ==
You must install python2 and numpy. Windows users may prefer using an python distribution instead manual separate installation.

=== Manual ===
* [http://python.org/ python 2.7.x] (python2 is default for windows now)
* [http://scipy.org/ numpy 1.7.x] Micromanager represent imaging data as multidimensional numpy arrays.

=== Using python distributions ===
It's convenient to install a distribution which includes Python, numpy, scientific libraries, GUI frameworks and IDEs. All distributions have a free version, some of them have extended paid version, and you can request free academic license.
* [https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/free/ Enthought's python distribution (EPD)]
* [http://continuum.io/downloads Anaconda], has package manager.
* [https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy PythonXY] totally free.

=== Useful libraries ===
* Scipy - scientific algorithms, multidimensional image processing toolbox.
* Matplotlib - fastest way to show your image data.
* Opencv - computer vision and image processing library. Sometimes faster than scipy.
* Pillow - very basic image processing. Scipy uses it for image loading and writing.
* Scikit-image - "pythonic" scientific-oriented image processing algorithms collection.
* [http://ipython.org/ IPython] - improved interactive python environment

== Micromanager installation ==

=== Windows & Mac ===
[[Download_Micro-Manager_Latest_Release|Download]] and install Micro-Manager on your computer. Add Micromanager installation folder to [https://docs.python.org/2/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH PYTHONPATH] (i.e. "''C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager-1.4''", it should contain <small>''MMCorePy.py''</small> and <small>''_MMCorePy.pyd''</small> files). Create variable if it not exist. At now you can import MMCorePy without an error.

=== Linux ===
MM package from your distribution repository, in most cases, ships with CMMCore, MMCorePy (python 2 or 3 wrapper) and MMCoreJ, but without GUI. Python and Numpy would be installed by your package manager as dependency. In normal way, you don't need changing any system variable. 

== Using Python API ==
Familiarize yourself with Micro-Manager and learn how to connect it to your hardware by MMStudio GUI.
* Find your device on [[Device Support|this page]] and figure out what adapter you need.
* [[Micro-Manager Configuration Guide|Micro-Manager Configuration Guide]] help you to understand how properties work.
* Read the general [[Micro-Manager Programming Guide|Micro-Manager Programming Guide]]
* Use [https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc/MMCore/html/class_c_m_m_core.html API].

=== First steps ===
{{Note|Next code snippets aims to be most generic. We use numpy and matplotlib "as is" from pure python interactive shell, but it's convenient to use IPython with nice autocompletion capabilities.}}

Start python interactive session. Import `MMCorePy` and make sure everything is working properly.

    >>> import MMCorePy
    >>> mmc = MMCorePy.CMMCore()  # Instance micromanager core
    >>> mmc.getVersionInfo()
    'MMCore version 2.3.2'
    >>> mmc.getAPIVersionInfo()
    'Device API version 59, Module API version 10'

We just get some basic information about current Micromanager installation. If there an `ImportError`, check your PYTHONPATH variable. If output is too verbose, run <small>mmc.enableStderrLog(False); mmc.enableDebugLog(False)</small>.

=== Device loading ===
{{Note|You can get all needed parameter's names from Micromanager configuration file, generated by MMStudio.}}

Let's take step closer to hardware. Micromanager have couple of dummy devices, suitable for learning purposes. Load DemoCamera:

    # Demo camera example, continuation of previous listing
    >>> mmc.loadDevice('Camera', 'DemoCamera', 'DCam')
    >>> mmc.initializeAllDevices()
    >>> mmc.setCameraDevice('Camera')

=== Property discovery ===
Every device has [[Micro-Manager User's Guide#Exploring devices: Device.2FProperty Browser|properties]] - settings that let you control the device more precisely. Default values should be fine, but if you need something sophisticated, [https://github.com/radioxoma/micromanager-samples/blob/master/mm_print_properties.py this example] help you figure out how to explore it.

=== Snapping single image ===
Images returned as numpy array by calls to an instance of the pythonized Micro-Manager [https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/doc/MMCore/html/class_c_m_m_core.html CMMCore] class. The array <small>dtype</small> depends on property named ''PixelType'' (see below).

==== Grayscale ====

    >>> mmc.snapImage()
    >>> img = mmc.getImage()  # img - it's just numpy array
    >>> img
    array([[12, 12, 13, ..., 11, 12, 12],
           [12, 12, 13, ..., 11, 12, 12],
           [12, 13, 13, ..., 12, 12, 12],
           ...,
           [22, 22, 22, ..., 22, 22, 22],
           [22, 22, 22, ..., 22, 22, 22],
           [22, 22, 22, ..., 22, 22, 22]], dtype=uint8)

DemoCamera snaps grayscale 8-bit image, by default. It presented as two-dimensional numpy array. Let's show image data with matplotlib.

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> plt.imshow(img, cmap='gray')
    >>> plt.show()  # And window will appear

==== Color ====
Of course, color image is more suitable for optical microscopy purposes. So take one, if your camera support it:
    
    >>> mmc.setProperty('Camera', 'PixelType', '32bitRGB')  # Change pixel type
    >>> rgb32 = mmc.getImage()
    >>> rgb32
    array([[1250067, 1250067, 1315860, ..., 1250067, 1250067, 1250067],
           [1250067, 1315603, 1315860, ..., 1250067, 1250067, 1250067],
           [1250067, 1315859, 1315860, ..., 1250067, 1250067, 1250067],
           ...,
           [1246483, 1246483, 1246483, ..., 1181204, 1246740, 1246484],
           [1246483, 1246483, 1246483, ..., 1246740, 1246740, 1246483],
           [1246483, 1246483, 1312019, ..., 1246740, 1246740, 1246483]], dtype=uint32)

Interesting output isn't it? We expect something like 3-dimensional RGB array, but get bunch of 32-bit uints in 2-D shape.

==== Numpy array ====
Now we should look at RGB32 pixel data structure. Every pixel has 32-bit depth and contain 4 values for blue, green, red and blank channel. Blank channel is more technical peculiarity, than necessity.

    low memory address    ---->      high memory address
    | pixel | pixel | pixel | pixel | pixel | pixel |...
    |-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|...
    |B|G|R|A|B|G|R|A|B|G|R|A|B|G|R|A|B|G|R|A|B|G|R|A|...
    http://avisynth.nl/index.php/RGB32

Let's numpy handle that.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> rgb32.shape
    (512, 512)
    >>> rgb = rgb32.view(dtype=np.uint8).reshape(
            rgb32.shape[0], rgb32.shape[1], 4)[...,2::-1]
    >>> rgb.shape
    (512, 512, 3)
    >>> rgb.dtype
    dtype('uint8')

It is a fastest way to get pixel data as RGB array without copying. There is no conversion - just creating new view to same data. Now you can process image with scipy or scikits-image. Note, that opencv uses BGR order (replace slice to [..., :3] for that).

=== Continuous acquisition ===
{{Warning|'''Don't run this code directly.''' It's a partial sample.}}

    mmc.startContinuousSequenceAcquisition(1)
    while True:
        if mmc.getRemainingImageCount() > 0:
            frame = mmc.getLastImage()
            # or frame = mmc.popNextImage()

=== Code examples ===

A longer example script, [https://github.com/mdcurtis/micromanager-upstream/blob/master/bindist/any-platform/MMCoreWrapDemo.py MMCoreWrapDemo.py], is available in the Micro-Manager root directory.
