## Micro-Manager versions

**Micro-Manager 2.0** is the actively developed, current, version of
Micro-Manager that you should use unless there is functionality in 1.4
that you need. 1.4 is no longer developed (except for the ASI diSPIM
plugin). Nightly builds are usually fine to use, and have the latest
features and bug fixes. If you encounter a bug in a release version,
always test with the latest nightly build to see if the bug has been
fixed already.

{% include notice icon="info" content="Due to security features of macOS 10.12
and later, Micro-Manager may not start when opening ImageJ.app. To circumvent
this, within the Micro-Manager folder in Applications, hold command and drag
ImageJ onto the desktop. Then hold command and drag it back in. Then try
running again. In addition, you need to CTRL-click or right-click and select
Open (instead of simply double-clicking) the first time you open it.  See
[Installation Notes](Micro-Manager_Installation_Notes)." %}
