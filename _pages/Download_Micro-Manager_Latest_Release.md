## Micro-Manager versions

**Micro-Manager 2.0** is the actively developed, current, version of
Micro-Manager that you should use unless there is functionality in 1.4
that you need. 1.4 is no longer developed (except for the ASI diSPIM
plugin). Nightly builds are usually fine to use, and have the latest
features and bug fixes. If you encounter a bug in a release version,
always test with the latest nightly build to see if the bug has been
fixed already.

## Micro-Manager 2.0.0 (July 13, 2021)

  - [Windows 64-bit](https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/~MM/builds/2.0/Windows/MMSetup_64bit_2.0.0.exe),
    148 MB  
  - [Windows 32-bit](https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/~MM/builds/2.0/Windows/MMSetup_32bit_2.0.0.exe),
    143 MB  
Requires Windows 7-10. Windows 10 recommended. Device drivers may have
other requirements.

  - [Mac OS X (Universal
    Binary)](https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/~MM/builds/2.0/Mac/Micro-Manager-2.0.0.dmg),
    111 MB  
Requires Mac OS X 10.5 or greater. Device drivers may have other
requirements.

{% include notice icon="info" content="Due to security features of macOS 10.12
and later, Micro-Manager may not start when opening ImageJ.app. To circumvent
this, within the Micro-Manager folder in Applications, hold command and drag
ImageJ onto the desktop. Then hold command and drag it back in. Then try
running again. In addition, you need to CTRL-click or right-click and select
Open (instead of simply double-clicking) the first time you open it.  See
[Installation Notes](Micro-Manager_Installation_Notes)." %}

  - Under GNU/Linux platforms, you will need to [compile micro-manager from
    source](Linux_installation_from_source_(Ubuntu)).

### Partial list of differences with 1.4

  - Completely re-designed API
  - Better looking User Interface with Day/Night skins
  - [Pycro-Manager](https://github.com/micro-manager/pycro-manager)
  - User Profiles (settings can be saved per user)
  - Image Inspector with overlays (time stamps, Size bar)
  - Versatile viewer with build-in Projection
  - ClearVolume 3D viewer integration
  - Export as displayed to ImageJ

## Nightly Builds

Although there has been no official release for quite some time, further
development and multiple bug fixes have occurred in the 1.4 branch in
parallel with development of 2.0. Nightly builds are almost always
stable and a better choice for most users than the latest official
release.

  - [Version 1.4
    (Windows)](https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/~MM/nightlyBuilds/1.4/Windows)
