This adapter is a modification of the more comprehensive ZeissCAN29
adapter, specific to AxioZoom microscope. The same as ZeissCAN29 it uses
CAN29 bus interface. The adapter directly communicates to the microscope
through the serial port (i.e., it does not use the MTB library provided
by Zeiss) and therefore works on all platforms. No additional software
is needed. USB and ethernet communication is not supported.

Zeiss microscopes require a female-to-female null-modem cable for RS-232
communication.

You will need to define all hardware that is part of your microscope in
the Hardware Configuration Wizard (i.e., Micro-Manager does not query
the microscope itself for devices present). In any case, you will need
to define the 'ZeissScope' device as this defines the serial port to
which the scope is attached.
