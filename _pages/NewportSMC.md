**Serial Cable**

</td>
<td markdown="1">

Straight through with pins 1,4 and 6 connected, and pins 8,7 connected
(see SMC manual). Not sure what that means exactly, however, a straight
through cable with all pins on one end connected to the corresponding
pin on the other end worked fine.

Please follow the SMC manual and instructions to conifigure the SMC
controller(s) first. As of the 1.4.23 August 18 nightly build, the
adapter can work with multiple SMC controllers. Set the RS485 address
using the tools provided by Newport, and enter the RS485 as a
pre-initialization property in the Micro-Manager Hardware Configuration
Wizard.

Find the Newport documentation
[here](http://www.newport.com/SMC100-Single-Axis-DC-or-Stepper-Motion-Controller/400968/1033/info.aspx#tab_Literature).

Of note is the homing behavior. After switching on the controller, it
will need to be homed before the stage can be used. Micro-Manager will
home the device on startup. Homing behavior can be configured using the
Newport software. To get "re-usable" positions, make sure that the
homing strategy involves moving to one of the limit switches.

As with any stage, you may need to set the Core-TimeoutMs property to
something larger than the default 5 seconds to avoid timing out when
moving large distances.
