Note: According to user reports, this device adapter appears to be
unstable in recent versions of Micro-Manager (1.4.15-1.4.20).

To use a SPOT camera with Micro-Manager on Windows or Mac, you will need
to download and install the driver from the [Diagnostic
website](http://www.diaginc.com/downloads.php) under the heading "SPOT
Camera DLL".

The code for this adapter was written by Karl Hoover.

Changes in 1.3.41:  
â€¢ Initial implementation tested with Flex 15.2, Idea 28.2, and RT Slider
2.3.0 cameras on Windows XP SP3
