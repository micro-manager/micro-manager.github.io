{% include Note text=" The device adapter does not let you choose the IP address of the iChrome MLE box. As a consequence, if multiple iChrome MLEs are present on the network, it is not possible to specify which one to connect to. A workaround is to control one of the laser combiner via serial communication and the [[Toptica_iChrome_MLE|corresponding device adapter]]. (Joran Deschamps, EMBL)" %}
