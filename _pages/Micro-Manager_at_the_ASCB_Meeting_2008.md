title: Micro-Manager at the ASCB Meeting 2008
layout: page
---

For the third year in a row, we presented the Micro-Manager software in
a booth in the Exhibit Hall at the [annual meeting of the
ASCB](http://www.ascb.org/meetings/) in San Francisco. Our goal was to
introduce the Micro-Manager software to people who are not yet aware of
its existence, to get feedback from existing Micro-Manager users, and to
demonstrate new capabilities for very fast image acquisition.

At each time point, a z-stack of 5 slices (with 2 micron intervals) was acquired. Exposure time was 66.6 msec, total time to acquire a single time point (10 images) was less than 700 msec.

To demonstrate fast image acquistion we used a spinning disk confocal
system
([Yokogawa](http://www.yokogawa.com/scanner/products/csuX1e.htm)/[Solamere](http://www.solameretech.com/))
equipped with a [Hamamatsu EM camera
(C9100-13)](http://sales.hamamatsu.com/en/products/system-division/cameras/all-uv-vis-ir-cameras/part-c9100-13.php),
[ASI](http://www.asiimaging.com/) XY and piezo X-stage,
[Zeiss](http://www.zeiss.com) AxioObserver Z1, multi-color laser launch
and AOTF ([Solamere](http://www.solameretech.com/)), Mac Pro computer
and screen ([Apple](http://www.apple.com)) and an
[Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) micro-controller. All equipment
(except for the Arduino;) was made available to us by the respective
company (Thanks!). For fast image acquistion, the camera was run in
self-triggered mode, resulting in continuous acquisition at a rate
limited almost only by the exposure time. Synchronization of the AOTF
and piezo stage can not be accomplished by the computer since the
computer has no way of figuring out when exactly the exposure happens.
The solution is to use a TTL from the camera that signals when the
camera is exposing (many, but not all scientific grade cameras have this
capability) and use this TTL to drive a sequence of different output
patterns on the Arduino micro-controller. Thus, the TTL of the camera is
connected to an input port of the micro-controller. The micro-controller
is then instructed to cycle through a sequence of digital output
patterns. To this end, we wrote [a
program](https://valelab.ucsf.edu/svn/micromanager2/branches/micromanager1.3/DeviceAdapters/Arduino/AOTFcontroller/AOTFcontroller.pde)
that runs on the Arduino and a Micro-Manager device adapter that
interacts with this program (available in Micro-Manager version 1.3). A
few other useful modes are included in this Arduino program, including a
simple/cheap way to control TTLs (6 at the moment, but this can be
expanded to 12), ability to do 'blanking' (only expose with light when
the camera is exposing), and to run a sequence of events using the
build-in clock of the Arduino. We also added a 2-channel DA chip so that
we could control light intensity of the AOTF. Acquisition in
Micro-Manager is run from a Beanshell
[script](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/MMwiki/images/3/3f/media/MultiFastZStackASI.bsh)
that puts the incoming images in the correct order in the Image5D viewer

We were very encouraged by the interest and overwhelmingly positive
response both from the user community and from the industry. On the ASCB
exhibit floor we noted Micro-Manager controlling equipments in the
booths of [Point
Source](http://www.point-source.com/newsview.asp?id=29),
[Agilent](http://www.till-photonics.com/Products/imic.php), and
[Apogee](http://www.ccd.com/)! Thanks everyone for stopping by at our
booth and for all the support our project is getting from the industry!
