ÂµManager has the ability to create customized hotkeys that can perform
any action or set of actions that you create a script for. This page
describes the process for setting up a new hotkey.

1.  Go to the Tools menu and select "Script Panel" to bring up the
    Beanshell scripting panel. From here you can create, modify, and run
    scripts as described [on this
    page](https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Script_Panel_GUI).
2.  Create a script that does what you want, and save it to a file. In
    this screenshot, we have created a script "Exposure.bsh" that sets
    the exposure time to 50ms, and then refreshes the GUI so it shows
    the new exposure time.

3.  In the upper-left corner of the scripting panel, click the "Add"
    button. This will add the script to the list of scripts that can be
    used for shortcuts.

    menu.

5.  Click the "Add" button. This will add a new row that, by default,
    has an action of "Snap" and a corresponding command key of "space".
    Click on the space icon; it should turn red. Hit 1, to change the
    hotkey to trigger when you type 1. Click on "Snap" and a menu will
    come up; at the bottom should be our Exposure.bsh script. Select it.

6.  Close the hotkeys dialog. Now, whenever you type 1 in the program
    and you aren't modifying a text field, the exposure time will be set
    to 50ms.
