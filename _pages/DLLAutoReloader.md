The DLL Auto Reloader plugin (currently Windows only) automatically
reloads a device adapter DLL whenever it has been compiled. This feature
is intended to help speed up device adapter development. Here's how to
use it:

1.  Once Micro-Manager is running, choose DLL Auto Reloader from the
    plugins menu.
2.  Click the single button, and choose a directory where a copy of your
    device adapter's updated DLLs are saved. This location may be
    bin\_Win32, bin\_x64, or the directory where Visual Studio is
    generating the DLL.

Now, whenever you have made a change to your device adapter, you can
compile it, and the plugin will automatically reload the device adapter
in your running Micro-Manager instance, so you can immediately test the
changes.
