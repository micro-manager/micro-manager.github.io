The Toptica iBeamSmart lasers are usually controlled using two channels
(see Toptica's software Topas). The FINE settings affecting only the
first channel, while the digital modulation (optional) acts only on the
second channel.

This device adapter (module **iBeamSmartCW**) makes use of a hidden
control mode (called CW) that simplifies the interface. In the **CW
mode**, the laser is controlled using a single channel while allowing
FINE and digital modulation (if the option is present).

Upon quitting Micro-manager, the device adapter switches back the laser
to **normal control mode**.

{% include Important text=" If the laser is in '''CW mode''', it will no longer be controllable by the Topas software from Toptica. '''This can happen when Micro-Manager crashes unexpectedly and the device adapter is not properly unloaded'''. Before using Topas, load the device adapter in Micro-manager and quit the software. The laser will then be usable with Toptica's software." %}

In order to switch faster to normal mode, another device is available in
the device adapter: **iBeamSmartNormal**. This device **does not** allow
controlling the laser as it sole purpose is to switch back the laser to
normal control mode.

This device adapter has been tested with Micro-manager 1.4.22 and
2.0.0-beta on Windows 7.
