{% include notice icon="info" content="As of nightly builds starting 20180404, no longer rename xiapi64.dll.  Just copy that file to the Micro-Manager directory." %}
{% include notice icon="info" content="As of nightly builds starting 20180404, the
naming scheme of the camera has been changed. If your configuration file
stops working, you may need to open it in a text editor, find a line
that looks like: `Device,FastCam,XIMEACamera, 9652450`, and replace the
space in front of the camera number with a `0`, resulting in:
`Device,FastCam,XIMEACamera,09652450`." %} {% include notice icon="info" content="As
of nightly builds starting 20180404, changes were made to property
names. Your configuration file may stop working, but can probably be
easily fixed. For instance, I had to change `Mono 12` to `Mono16` to get
my configuration file to work again." %}
