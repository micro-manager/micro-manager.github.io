This adapter controls the Thorlabs FilterWheel FW102B and FW212B. A
manual can be found
[here](http://www.thorlabs.com/Thorcat/16600/media/16667-D02.pdf). Note that
the filter wheel has a USB connection. The software that comes with the
filterwheel will install a driver for USB to serial converter that
appears as a serial port in Micro-Manager. If such a driver can be found
on Mac or Linux, this adapter will work on those platforms too (please
share experiences here).
