Micro-Manager adapter to serial ports on Windows. Works with 'real'
serial ports, USB-serial converters, and PCI-serial cards. There are two
limitations that we are aware of: You can not use more than 9 serial
ports, and on older computers the serial port adapter causes problems
with the Hardware config wizard (when starting the Hardware Config
wizard, the serial ports are not release properly and cannot be reused
until you restart the computer. Only known workaround is to write the
config file by hand).

We have seen a number of instances in which USB-Serial adapters worked
unreliably. Especially in cases of heavy serial communication, these
devices regularly cause errors that will stop image acquisition. This is
something we will look into further, however, whenever possible use a
serial port build into your computer, or - when this is not available -
a PCI-based serial port.

The following experiences of users with PCI Serial-expansion cards and
USB-serial adapters were reported on the Micro-Manager mailing list:
