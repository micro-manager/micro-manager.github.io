Micro-Manager is free and open source -- it is funded by a grant from
the NIH (US National Institutes of Health). The Vale lab's development
and maintenance of Micro-Manager will depend on more grants in the
future, and these grants will only be awarded if researchers cite their
use of Micro-Manager in their scientific publications.

When you publish results using Micro-Manager, please cite one of the
following papers:
