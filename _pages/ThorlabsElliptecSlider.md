The device adapter controls the Thorlabs Elliptec sliders ELL6 (two
positions) and ELL9 (four positions), as well as the stages ELL17 and
ELL20. The ELL6 can also be loaded as a shutter.

In addition to the COMport, the user need to set the communication
channel of the device (from 0 to F). The devices have a default to
channel 0. The channel can be easily read out from the Elliptec software
(see Thorlab's Elliptec page). When chaining multiple Elliptec devices
on the same COMport, different channels must be set for the individual
devices.

{% include notice icon="note" content=" The ELL9 can be slow to get to a new position, it will therefore give a '''TimeOut error''' if the time out of the COMport is set too low (e.g. the default 500 ms). We advise using a TimeOut of 2s for the ELL9, and potentially for the ELL17/ELL20 as well." %}
