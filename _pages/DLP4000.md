The DLP4000 is a development board containing a DMD (digital mirror device).  It was produced by Texas Instruments ~2009-2010 and was quickly succeeded by the [http://www.ti.com/tool/dlpd4x00kit DLP4100].  If you happen to have one of these and want to use it (we are in that situation), the following notes may be useful:

- The DLP4000 only has 32-bit drivers.  It may be possible to run the board under 32-bit Windows 7, however, the easiest way seems to be to use [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-and-use-windows-xp-mode-in-windows-7 Windows XP Mode] (remember to install a 32-bit version of Micro-Manager).

- Install the driver for the DLP4000 (ours is called 2510196_Discovery_4000_Explorer_V1.0_Setup) within Windows XP.  Attach the USB cable and connect the device to Windows XP. Ours shows up as "DLI USB FX2 Firmware 2008". 

- Copy the file "usb_main.bin" to your Micro-Manager directory (likely C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager1.4).

- Start up Micro-Manager, go through the Hardware Configuration Wizard and add the device "DMD4000".  If the wind blows in the right direction, this may succeed and your are ready to use the DMD.
