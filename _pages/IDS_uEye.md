Requires drivers from IDS (version 4.30 or higher), which can be
downloaded from the [IDS
site](http://en.ids-imaging.com/download-ueye.html).

### Supported features

  - Monochrome and color cameras. The available modes/bit depths can be
    selected in the properties browser ("Pixel Type").
  - Gain.
  - Binning.
  - ROI.
  - External/internal triggering.

### Notes

  - For color, currently only the modes "BGRA8" and "RGBA8" are
    supported.
  - The "Frame rate" property will not necessarily affect the real frame
    rate in the live-mode for every camera model. It does, however,
    determine the maximal exposure time.
  - Gamma correction is deactivated.
  - If several cameras are connected, currently only the first camera in
    the list will be addressed.
  - With Linux and OpenJDK, using the color modes may cause problems
    (monochrome modes work), with Sun/Oracle JDK all modes work.
