The Stage Control plugin functions as a virtual joystick. Pressing a
single arrow will move the stage a little bit, double arrows will move
it more, and triple arrows will move it further. The lower part of the
window lets you set the distance that will be traveled and there are
buttons that will set these values to 1 pixel, 10% of the field and the
whole field.
