# Introduction

In order to control a specific microscope, the Micro-Manager application
needs to know what hardware is part of the microscope, load and
initialize the appropriate drivers, define configuration presets, create
labels for device positions, etc.. Typically, on startup the
Micro-Manager application loads a configuration file containing commands
configuring all aspects of the system. To start using Micro-Manager, you
will first need to create a configuration file specific for your system

![Startup screen](media/Startup.gif "fig:Startup screen")  
Figure 1. Startup screen: selection of the configuration file  
Upon Micro-Manager startup an introductory splash screen pops-up
displaying the configuration file that is about to be loaded. By
default, Micro-Manager attempts to load the file used in the previous
session. You can either use that file, load another configuration file,
or start Micro-Manager with no configuration file by selecting "none".
After pressing OK the initialization process starts and when it finishes
without errors, Micro-Manager is ready for use. Configuration files can
be also loaded at any time using the <span>**Tools \| Load Hardware
Configuration**</span> command from the main menu. Each time you load a
configuration file, the current configuration is un-initialized (shut
down) and the new one is initialized. Re-loading a configuration file
has (almost) the same effect as restarting the application. You may also
switch and save any configuration files under the **Tools** menu.

The way to create a configuration file is by using the Configuration
Wizard (<span>**Tools \| Hardware Configuration Wizard**</span>), which
will guide you, step-by-step, through the configuration process and
generate a configuration file for you. The wizard will generate a text
file that can be edited in a text editor. The syntax of this file is
described [below](#configuration-file-syntax "wikilink").



# Hardware Configuration Wizard

The hardware configuration wizard guides you through the creation of a
configuration file in 6 steps. Each step will display specific help in
the right side of the wizard window. Before you begin, you should
assemble as much information about your hardware as possible. For
instance, you should know which serial ports of your computer are
attached to what hardware. Preferably, you should test the functionality
of the hardware with software provided by the vendor. Information and
helpful advice about specific devices can be found in the [Device
Support](Device_Support "wikilink") page. When you get stuck, you can
get support through the [Micro-Manager mailing
list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/micro-manager-general).
Remember, this is the most important part in getting Micro-Manager to be
fully functional.

![Hardware wizard step
2](media/Wizardstep2.png "fig:Hardware wizard step 2")  
Figure 2. Step 2 of the hardware configuration wizard: selection of
devices.  
You can exit the wizard at any step by closing the wizard window. You
will be prompted to save the configuration file. Doing so (even when
something did not work) will be helpful in trouble shooting potential
issues. The most critical part of the wizard is in step 2. At this point
the hardware is being initialized, and errors/problems may manifest
themselves here. At the end of the wizard, save the file using the
'.cfg' extension.



# Configuration Presets

Any property that Micro-Manager knows about can be changed using the
Property Browser (<span>**Tools \| Device/Property Browser**</span>).
Changing properties using the Property Browser quickly becomes cumberson
and impracticle. Micro-Manager therefore uses the concept of
'Configuration Presets' that let you quickly change a group of device
properties. Configuring these Configuration Presets in a meaningful way
is a very important part of configuring Micro-Manager. Configuration
Presets also let you modify the User Interface of Micro-Manager to suit
your needs.

![Configuration Presets](media/Presets.gif "fig:Configuration Presets")  
Figure 3. Example of Configuration Presets in the Main Micro-Manager
window  
Before setting up Configuration Presets, you should familiarize yourself
with the [Device/Property
Browser](Micro-Manager_User's_Guide#exploring-devices-deviceproperty-browser "wikilink").
It is also worthwhile to experiment with the Configuration Presets in
the demo configuration.

![Preset Editor](media/GroupEditor.png "fig:Preset Editor")  
Figure 4. Initial Screen of the Preset Editor  
To make a new configuration group (a new row in the table with
**Configuration settings**), press the Group '+' button at the bottom
left of the Configuration Settings table. A **Group Editor** window will
appear that looks similar to the Device/Property Browser, but has a
third column called 'Use in Group?'. Check the box in the 'Use' column
for any property that you want to be included in this configuration
group. For instance, you might want to make a group called 'Channel' in
which you 'Use' the emission and excitation filter wheels in your system
and also set the Core-Shutter (to switch between the fluorescent and
transmitted light shutter).

You will now be presented with a second window, (the **Preset Editor**),
that will list only those properties you have chosen for your new group.
Set the properties that you selected to their desired positions and name
the Preset (for instance: 'GFP'). Click 'OK', and you will have the
first Configuration Prest in this group. To add Presets to the group,
select the group (by clicking on the name of the group, 'Channel' in
this example), and clicking the Preset '+' button. The Preset Editor
will appear again for each new preset. The 'Configuration' column in the
user interface will now be a dropdown menu, selecting an item from this
menu will change the state of your microscope.

When you select only a single property in the 'Use' column when making a
new Configuration Preset Group, Micro-Manager will do some magic. For
instance, when this property is displayed as a slider in the
Device/Property Browser, a slider will appear in the main Micro-Manager
window. If the property has a few values (like a filter wheel), all
available values will appear in a dropdown list in the main window. This
way you can quickly add control over a single device property, for
instance the position of a filter wheel, to the main Micro-Manager
window.

Once you are satisfied with your current presets you save them into the
current configuration file (or a new one) using "Save" button next to
'Configuration settings'. You can save the presets to the configuration
file that you made previously. Next time you start up with that
configuration file, your presets will be automatically loaded.

The 'Edit' and '-' (Delete) buttons allow you to change and remove
Configuration Groups and Presets. If you add a property to a Group, then
all existing Presets in that Group will now include the current value of
the new Property.

## Core Properties

In the [Device/Property
Browser](Micro-Manager_User's_Guide#exploring-devices-deviceproperty-browser "wikilink")
you will find a list of properties of the Micro-Manager Core, such as
core-camera, core-shutter etc. Micro-Manager can work with multiple
cameras, shutters etc., however, commands will work only on the 'active'
camera, shutter, etc. If your system has multiple shutters, such as a
fluorescent shutter and a trans-illumination shutter you should set the
'active' shutter using the core-shutter property. In configuration
groups, never set the state of a shutter directly, rather, rely on
Micro-Manager's Autoshutter functionality and use the core-shutter
property to select the shutter that should be opened/closed. For
instance, in GFP channel, set the core-shutter property to fluorescent
shutter (and do not include the state of the fluorescent shutter) and in
the DIC (or trans) channel set the core-shutter property to the
trans-illumination shutter.



# Startup Presets

There are a few configuration group/preset names with special meaning to
Micro-Manager. If you make a configuration preset group called 'System',
then you can define the groups 'Startup' and 'Shutdown'. These
configuration presets will be applied on startup and shutdown of
Micro-Manager respectively.



# Pixel Size Calibration

Pixel size calibrations are organized in a way similar to Configuration
Preset Groups. You will define a group of properties that affect the
pixel size, and when the current settings of the system 'matches' one of
the Pixel Size Calibration 'Presets', Micro-Manager will apply that
pixel size to the metadata of the images you take.

![Pixel Size Calibration
Editor](media/Calibration.gif "fig:Pixel Size Calibration Editor")  
Figure 5. Pixel Size Calibration Editor  
To set up Pixel Size Calibrations, start the Pixel Size Calibration
editor (<span>**Tools \| Pixel Size Calibration**</span>). Click the
'New' button. A window, very similar to the window you saw when setting
up new Configuration Preset Groups will appear. Check the boxes in the
'Use' column for those properties that affect the pixel size i.e
objectives, auxiliary magnification (Optovar) etc. Do not check the
camera 'Binning'property (binning is automatically taken into account by
Micro-Manager). Some other properties might not appear in the list since
they are automatically taken into account (so called 'Magnifier'
devices, these automatically tell Micro-Manager how they affect pixel
size). Give this Pixel Size Calibration a label (the name is
unimportant, it should be unique and might help you to remember the
settings) and enter the pixel size. When you press 'New' again, only the
previously selected properties will appear. Set these to the appropriate
settings, give a label and the pixel size. The Pixel Size can also be
edited inside the 'Pixel Size calibration' window.

If a non-motorized device affects the pixel size calibration (for
instance: your objective turret is non-motorized) you can add a device
from the demo-adapter to represent this non-motorzied device and include
this demo device in the pixel size calibration settings. When you now
manually change the setting of the non-motorized device you should also
change the setting of the demo device and Micro-Manager will select the
correct pixel size calibration.

Again, do not forget to save the configurations after editing pizel size
calibrations (you can use the 'Save' button next to Configuration
Presets in the main window to this end). These settings are saved in the
same file to describe the hardware and configuration presets (your
'configuration' file).



# Configuration file syntax

A configuration is defined in a text file (with default extension
\*.cfg) containing a list of simple commands to build the desired system
state: devices, labels, equipment, properties, and configurations. The
format is as follows:  
\* Each line consists of a number of string fields separated by ","
(comma) characters. No extra spaces are allowed for formatting, i.e.
space characters will treated as parts of the field.

-   Lines beginning with "\#" are ignored (can be used for comments).  
-   Each line in the file will be parsed by the system and as a result a
    corresponding command will be immediately executed.  

The first field in the line always specifies the command from the
following set of values:  

-   Device -- loads device  
-   Label -- attaches a label to the specified device position  
-   Equipment -- defines various equipment attributes used for image
    annotation  
-   Property -- sets a specific device property
-   ConfigGroup -- defines a single entry in the configuration group  

    Remaining fields in the line are used for specifying the
    corresponding command parameters. The number of parameters depends
    on the actual command used.  

    The following listing shows configuration file for the Demo setup.

# Memory Settings

<div id="MemorySettings">
</div>

It is often necessary to adjust memory settings in order to optimize
Micro-Manager performance and prevent errors. Different parts of
Micro-Manager use different types of memory that can be individually
tuned.

The ImageJ memory limit (**ImageJ \| Edit \| Options \| Memory &
Threads...**), and the sequence buffer size (**Tools \| Options**) can
be changed. These each need to be large enough for what they are used
for, but small enough to leave RAM for the other, and for the Operating
System.

The sequence buffer is used to hold freshly acquired images until the
Micro-Manager application is ready to process (display, save, etc.)
them. It helps absorb occasional glitches that slow down software
processing, so that the camera can acquire images at its set rate. The
sequence buffer is not used for Snap acquisitions or those
Multi-Dimensional Acquisitions where there is plenty of time between
frames.

The ImageJ memory limit (actually the maximum amount of memory that can
be used by the Java Virtual Machine running ImageJ/Micro-Manager)
determines the amount of RAM that can be used for general application
memory. To complicate matters, some versions of Micro-Manager store
images outside of this JVM memory (1.4 since 2013, and 2.0 until April
2020), whereas others (pre-2013 and 2.0 since April 2020) store images
inside the ImageJ memory limit. If you are unsure which one you use,
open the ImageJ memory monitor tool (**ImageJ \| Plugins \| Utilities \|
Monitor Memory...**), run an acquisition that stores a significant
number of images in RAM, and note if the memory usage goes up
accordingly (occasionally pressing the ImageJ status bar to invoke the
Java memory garbage collector). If memory usage stays low, your version
of MM stores images outside of the JVM memory.

Here are some guidelines for adjusting memory settings:

\- If Micro-Manager stores images outside of the JVM, you do not need to
set the ImageJ memory setting very large, unless you experience "out of
memory" errors when processing images using ImageJ and ImageJ plugins.
For the 64-bit version, 1-4 GB is recommended (but leave several GB of
your total RAM for other purposes). For the 32-bit version, it is
important *not* to set the ImageJ memory too large. 400-800 MB is
usually a good range, and you should not exceed 1.2 GB (a little larger
is okay on OS X).

\- If Micro-Manager stores images inside the JVM (2.0 since April 2020),
set the ImageJ memory limit as high as possible, but make sure the total
amount of memory set for the circular buffer plus ImageJ does not exceed
\~80-90% of the total memory in your computer.

\- For the sequence buffer size setting, try first setting the buffer to
20-100 times the size of a single image from your camera. You may get
"sequence buffer overflow" (also known as "circular buffer overflow")
errors during acquisitions, especially at high frame rates. If so, try
increasing the sequence buffer size (for fast streaming of large images,
much larger settings can sometimes be useful). You can also use the
Sequence Buffer Monitor plugin (**Plugins \| Developer Tools**) to see
how much of the sequence buffer is actually used during a
Multi-Dimensional Acquisition.

If you have another installation of ImageJ on your computer, keep in
mind that Micro-Manager uses its own copy of ImageJ and that you need to
set memory options on both.

Finally, note that the sequence buffer size setting is saved per user
profile, while the ImageJ memory setting is saved per copy of ImageJ.

# Troubleshooting

Micromanager GUI (MMStudio) handles other non-hardware settings through
[Java preferences
API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/prefs/package-summary.html)
(<small>java.util.prefs</small>), so they're persistent even after
uninstall. In some cases (e.g. after using development version or
upgrade) old properties can cause GUI misbehaviour (e.g. inability to
save changed histogram range).

Windows user can find preferences in
<small>HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\JavaSoft\\Prefs\\Org\\micromanager</small>
registry branch and remove manually. New properties will be created
automatically. Hardware configuration remains unchanged.
