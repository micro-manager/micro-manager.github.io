Supported since the 20180220 nightly builds (1.4 and 2.0beta).

### Installation

First, install Nikon's **Ti2 Control** Windows software from the [Nikon
Healthcare's Software Developer Toolkit
site](https://nisdk.recollective.com/microscopes) (registration required).
Make sure it can control your microscope.

If you are running Micro-Manager release 2.0.0 or a 2.0 series nightly
build dated 2022-03-02 or earlier, or any MM 1.4 (release or nightly),
you probably need Ti2 Control 1.2.0.

If you are running anything newer, please try the latest Ti2 Control
2.x first.

Next, copy the file `Ti2_Mic_Driver.dll` into the Micro-Manager folder.
The file is located at `C:\Program Files\Nikon\Ti2-SDK\bin`.

NikonTi2 should then appear in the Hardware Configuration Wizard.
