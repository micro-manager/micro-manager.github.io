Supported since the 20180220 nightly builds (1.4 and 2.0beta).

### Installation

First, install Nikon's [Ti2
Control](http://nikon.com/products/microscope-solutions/support/download/software/biological/index.htm)
software. Make sure it can control your microscope. (Some have reported
that ver. 2.1.0 does not work with Micro-Manager on Windows 10. Try
Nikon Ti2 Control for Windows Ver. 1.2.0.55.)

Next, copy the file `Ti2_Mic_Driver.dll` into the Micro-Manager folder.
The file is located at `C:\Program Files\Nikon\Ti2-SDK\bin`.

NikonTi2 should then appear in the Hardware Configuration Wizard.
