## Installation

This adapter will work with Princeton Instrument (PI) cameras that work
with PVCAM. Be aware that you will need to install the [PI version for
PVCAM](http://www.princetoninstruments.com/support/software.aspx). If
you had previously installed the Photometrics version of PVCAM, then you
need to manually complete de-installation using the following
instructions:
![](media/PhotometricsUninstall.zip "PhotometricsUninstall.zip")

If you encounter the following error message on startup: *Error code:
39  
* *Line 14: Property,Core,Initialize,1  
* *Error code: 22  
* *Device Undefined. Duplicate property names are not allowed.  
* then Micro-Manager was most likely not terminated in a graceful way
during the previous session. Simply quit Micro-Manager, reboot your
camera (by switching it off and back on again) and try again.
