This adapter controls Pecon devices: TempControl, CTI-Controller, CO2
Controller. No additional software is needed and should work on all
platforms (so far tested only on Windows). Port commands were generously
provided by PeCon GmbH. Serial port settings are 300 baud, 8 data bits,
2 stop bits, no parity, no handshaking, port timeout about 4 seconds.
You will need to define the 'Pecon' device and assign it to the correct
port. Adapter still needs to be optimized, tuned up and also stability
of adapter needs to be improved. Often, when error message pops up,
resending of the command solves the problem. Plugins for ImageJ for
recording incubation values to a file are planned for near future.
