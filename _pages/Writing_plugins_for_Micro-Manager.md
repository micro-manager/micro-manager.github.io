## Introduction
Writing a new Micro-Manager plugin involves two steps. First, you will write, test and debug your code. It is easiest to do this using a "Integrated Development Environment" (IDE) such as [NetBeans](Using_Netbeans), [Eclipse](Using_Eclipse) or [IntelliJ](Using_IntelliJ). Each IDE can be used to build plugins so that they can run on the computer they were written on without any additional steps.

If you think your plugin will be useful to anyone besides yourself (or if you want to use it on a computer other than the one you developed it on), you will likely want to distribute the plugin in the form of a .jar file that can simply be copied into the `mmplugins` folder and be recognized by Micro- Manager. Micro-Manager 2.0 uses [SciJava's plugin discovery mechanism](https://imagej.net/libs/scijava).  This uses [Java annotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_annotation) that need to be generated by your build environment.  Currently, we have no idea how to do that from an IDE, so the following instructions (based on [work by SophieH](https://forum.image.sc/t/mm2-projector-plugin-and-library-source-files/41370/13)) will help you use a command-line tool to build plugins that can run in Micro-Manager 2.0. If you figure out how to do this completely within an IDE, please contribute your notes!

## Setting up to write, debug and package plugins
Download and install a recent version of [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/Micro-Manager_Nightly_Builds).

Downloaded and install a Java JDK. Micro-Manager currently is build with JDK8, which can be freely downloaded from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8).

Download and install your IDE of choice. 

Clone the [Micro-Manager github repository](Micro-Manager_Source_Code). Optionally run the command ```git submodule update --init --recursive``` which will clone all submodules (currently the Core and devices, which you will not need to build a Java plugin).

Use the IDE to write and debug your plugin code (follow the links to the [NetBeans](Using_Netbeans), [Eclipse](Using_Eclipse) or [IntelliJ](Using_IntelliJ) pages for IDE-specific instructions). If you only want to run your plugin on the machine it was developed on, you do not need to proceed past this point. 

## Building a redistributable .jar file
These instructions will allow you to compile your code for distribution. Note that these instructions will only work on Windows. 

First, download and install [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi). 

You will need to set the following environment variables. On Windows, they can be added in
Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; System &gt; "Advanced system
settings" &gt; "Environment variables...".

-   `JAVA_HOME`: set to the path to your JDK installation, e.g.
    `C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jdk8u181-b13`. Do not add quotes to the value,
    even if it contains spaces.
-   `ANT_HOME`: set to the path to your Ant installation (whereever you
    placed the extracted binary package), e.g. `C:\apache-ant-1.9.16`. Do
    not add quotes to the value, even if it contains spaces.
-   `PATH`: It is convenient to add Ant to the command search path. You
    can append `;%ANT_HOME%\bin` to the end of the System `PATH`
    varialbe, or add a User variable named `PATH` and set its value to
    `%PATH%;%ANT_HOME%\bin`.
    
Verify that the Environment Variables were set correctly and  Ant is working properly by typing ```ant -version```. You should get a reply similar to:
    ```Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.16 compiled on July 10 2021```

In your terminal application (I use [Git bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win)), cd to the root of the micro-manager source code and ran the two following commands:
```
ant -f buildscripts/fetchdeps.xml
ant build-buildtools
```

**Copy files from binary installation of Micro-Manager**
If you had not yet done so, download and install a recent version of [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/Micro-Manager_Nightly_Builds). Copy the following .jar files from that Micro-Manger installation into the ```build\Java``` folder, which is located in the micro-manager source code folder you cloned (the ```build\Java``` folder should already contain the file ```AntExtensions.jar```):
```
MMJ_.jar
AcqEngJ-X.X.X.jar
MMCoreJ.jar
```

**Build and run your plugin code**
Change directory to micro-manager\plugins\Example, and issue the command ```ant jar```.  This should result in a file ```Example.jar``` in the ```build\Java\plugins``` directory.  Copy this jar file to the ```mmplugins``` folder of your Micro-Manager installation and it should appear in the menu and work.
