Micro-Manager adapter to serial ports on Mac and Linux. Works with
'real' serial ports, and USB-serial converters. Lists available serial
ports on Mac. The behavior of this adapter is exactly the same as the
one on Windows since Micro-Manager version 1.1.36. However, this adapter
also exposes the property: *DelayBetweenCharsMs*. This specifies the
time (in ms) that the computer waits in between sending a character to
the serial device. Set this low (0) for newer fast devices. You might
need to increase the value for older devices that cannot buffer serial
input adequately.
