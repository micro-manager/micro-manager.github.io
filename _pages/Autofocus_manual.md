## Autofocus setup

Micro-Manager needs to be told which autofocus device or plugin to use.
To do so, click on the Autofocus Options button on the main window.

See also [Simple Autofocus Manual](SimpleAutofocus "wikilink").

The following are autofocus plugins available in Micro-Manager:

## OughtaFocus

The OughtaFocus plugin uses [Brent's
algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_method) for finding a
maximum of a function. The plugin acquires images at different z
positions to iteratively search for maximimum image focus quality.

The plugin has a number of settings, available in the autofocus options
menu:

-   **SearchRange\_um**: OughtaFocus will search over z range specified,
    centered at the current z position.
-   **Tolerance\_um**: Search will stop when the z position's distance
    from maximum focus quality is estimated to be within the tolerance
    specified.
-   **CropFactor**: The plugin will apply a camera ROI to the center of
    the field of view during autofocus, to reduce the time required to
    read out each image. A CropFactor of 1 means that the entire field
    will be used.
-   **Exposure** specifies how long the plugin will expose each image
    during the autofocus routine.
-   **ShowImage** determines whether images will be displayed in the
    Live Window during the autofocus routine.
-   **Maximize** determines what property of the autofocusing image
    series will be used to evaluate the quality of focus. You can choose
    Mean, Standard Deviation, or Edges (a function that looks at the
    variance of the first derivative). Experiment with different methods
    to find the best one for your sample.
-   **Channel** allows you to select a channel preset to be used for
    autofocus -- if no Channel is selected, then the current hardware
    settings will be used.

## AutoFocus JAF(H&P) manual

Pakpoom (Tom) Substoontorn provided the following explanation of the
various settings in the autofocus dialog:

![](media/AutoFocusDialog.gif "AutoFocusDialog.gif")

Auto Focus Channel is the channel with which the autofocussing will be
carried out. Currently, the plugin uses the configuration preset group
'Channels', and you will need to type in the exact name of the channel
to be used.

StepNumber is the number of planes used in focusing above and below the
current plane. For instance, if my current zdistance at the beginning of
autofocus routine is 11um and I set the parameter as the following

```
         -1st stepsize: 1 micron 
         -1st stepNumber: 2 step
         -2nd stepsize: 0.3 micron
         -2nd stepNumber: 2 step
```

The program will take the image at 9,10, 11, 12, 13 um....Then, it finds
the sharpest image. Suppose the sharpest image is taken at 12 um. Then,
it take the image at 11.4, 11.7. 12, 12.3, 12.6 um. Again, it finds the
sharpest of these image. Suppose the sharpest one is at 11.7 um. Then,
the program set the microscope to 11.7 um as its best focus.

'shapness' of an image is computed by

```
         -applying 3x3 median filter to the image to remove noise
         -convolute image with a filter [-2 -1 0; -1 0 1; 0 1 2 ]
         -sum the square of each entry in the convoluted image.
```

Empirically, this 'sharpness value' is correspond to the sharpness I see
by eyes (for ecoli). In other words, for the same image field, the
sharpest image I see by eyes is the image with the maximum sharpness
value. The plot of 'sharpness' against zdistance is a single bell-shape
curve. i.e., the futher zdistance from the best focus zdistance, the
lower 'sharpness value' is.

I was planning to use while loop to repeat the search for the focus
(rather than just two rounds: coarse and fine). However, so far, these
coarse-fine search seem to be enough.

Crop ratio

```
 -- tell the program what fraction of image will be used for computing sharpness.
```

Suppose my image is 1000x600 pixel and my crop ratio is 0.5, the program
will use only the middle part of the image, size 500x300, to compute
sharpness and will discard the rest. In the past, I sometime use small
crop ratio (like 0.3) to make the program run faster (as it applies
median filter and convolute smaller matrix). However, right now I use
median filter and convolute functions implemented in imageJ, median
filter and convolution is so fast that the rate limiting step of the
program is no longer matrix operation, but the time of taking each
snapshot.

Threshold: This value tells the program when to give up the search.
Because during the best focus search the program take one snapshot and
compute its sharpness at a time (and given that the sharpness-zdistance
plot is a single bell-shape), the program will give up once it finds the
highest sharpness. The program stop taking snapshot when the current
sharpness is less than (the best image so far) X (1-Threshold) Consider
the following example, the program starts taking coarse image at 9
um-13um, threshold is 0.5 at 9 um sharpNess = 36

```
  10 um                       59
  11  um                      21--> the program stop coarse search here as 21< 59*0.5 
   
```

I'm not quite confident about this threshold trick. sometimes the single
bell-shape is not perfect. I would recommend setting high Threshold for
now.
