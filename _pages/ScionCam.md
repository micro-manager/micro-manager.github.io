*The company producing the Scion cameras has ceased to exist.
Fortunately, the company made the files needed to operate their cameras
available to us, and these will be accessible through this page.
However, we do not have any of these cameras and therefore cannot test
these instructions. Please update and clarify the following text!*

**Instructions:**  
Install the drivers for your platform:

If you are using Windows 7, please read this [technical
note](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/Scion/Drivers/technical_note_2.htm).
You may need to download the [FireWire
Drivers](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/Scion/Drivers/FireWireDrivers.exe).

After installing the drivers, install the shared library for your
platform:

<table>
<tr>
<td markdown="1">

</td>
<td markdown="1">

[Version

</td>

The following files were also provided by Scion:
[SFW\_MM\_13.exe](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/Scion/Micro-Manager/SFW_MM_13.exe)
Installs Camera support for Micro-Manager 1.3.40 Beta. Note: Existing
Micro-Manager 1.3.40 installation required. Windows 2000 - Windows 7
32-Bit Version 1.3.3

[SFWMM\_Intel\_12.dmg](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/Scion/Micro-Manager/SFWMM_Intel_12.dmg)
Installs Version 1.2 Micro-Manager and Scion CFW Camera camera support.
Mac OS 10.4 or higher (Intel only) Version 1.2

Then make a configuration file using the Micro-Manager hardware
configuration wizard.

There is an exposure delay enable option. If this option is off (value
of 0) then there will be no exposure delay of any kind. If this option
is set to on (1 or any other number) - then the optimal computed delay
to guarantee synchronization with the shutter is on during exposure is
activated. Hope this doesn't confuse - but some people aren't going to
want that delay as it will slow down full frame capture.

Martin Wessendorf made available a copy of [the installation CD that
came with his
camera](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/Scion/Scioninfodrivers.zip).
