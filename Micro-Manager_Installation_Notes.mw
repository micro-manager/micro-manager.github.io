<span>'''Updated on September 10, 2009'''</span><br /><br /> After you install Micro-Manager using the instructions for your platform, you can test-drive the software in demo-mode. The application will start in demo-mode by default after installation. To use Micro-Manager with an actual microscope you will need to configure the software for the specific hardware components that are part of your setup.<br /><br /> The configuration process includes editing configuration files and is described in the [documentation.php?object=Configguide Configuration Guide]. Installation includes a number of sample hardware configuration files (with extension *.cfg) provided only as an example or starting point - they need to be edited in order to use the system with any particular hardware setup.<br /><br />

== Windows ==

Run the installer (MM_Setup_1_x_xx.exe) and follow the prompts. The package includes a copy of ImageJ. You might need to install [http://www.java.com/getjava/ Java] and low-level drivers for your cameras and possible other equipment (see our [http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/MMwiki/index.php/Device_Support Device Documentation]), but nothing else is required to to fully use Micro-Manager.<br /><br /> There are no particular hardware requirements. However, for practical use we recommend Windows XP, with a 1.7-GHz or better processor and at least 512 MB of RAM.<br /><br />

== Mac OS X ==

Double click on the file MM_ImageJ.dmg. This will open a drive called 'MM_ImageJ'. The drive is on the desktop and in every Finder Window. Open the drive (by double-clicking). In the drive there is a folder called MM_ImageJ. You can install the application by dragging this folder to your Applications folder, or you can launch the application by opening the folder and double clicking the 'MM_ImageJ' icon.<br /><br /> By default, after the first installation Micro-Manager starts with the Demo configuration which loads software simulators for a number of commonly used devices. This configuration can be used to explore Micro-Manager features, train novice users and as a reference point for troubleshooting.<br /><br />

== If you already use ImageJ ==

Micro-Manager is packaged as an [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ ImageJ] plug-in and contains a copy of the entire ImageJ application, together with the Java run-time engine. Starting Micro-Manager will automatically start ImageJ as well. If you already use ImageJ and have it installed on your machine beforehand, the original installation will not be affected. Micro-Manager installs and uses its own copy of ImageJ. However, if you have any existing ImageJ macros or plugins that you want to use with Micro-Manager, you will have to copy them manually to the appropriate sub-folders within the root Micro-Manager folder.<br /><br /> Migrating your favorite ImageJ plugins to Micro-Manager installation should not cause any problems.
