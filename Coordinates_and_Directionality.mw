== '''Coordinates and Directionality in Micro-Manager''' ==

To assure that movement of stages and the orientation of images is as you expect, microscope acquisition software needs to have information about the direction of motion of stages and image orientation.  In Micro-Manager, we attempt to overcome confusion about directionality by mandating a single coordinate system.  The 'Micro-Manager' coordinate system uses micrometers as its unit, and places the origin (0,0) in the top left corner for XY stages (when viewed from above, this holds true for both inverted and upright microscopes).  Positive movement along the X-axis moves the stage to the left, positive movement along the Y-axis moves the stage to the top (away from the observer). This coordinate system follows that of SBS multi-well plate, with (for a 96 well plate) well A1 in the top left corner and well H12 in the bottom right corner (in the Micro-Manager coordinate system, well A1 will have low X and Y coordinates, and well H12 will have high X and Y coordinates).

It is the task of the stage adapter to guarantee that this coordinate system is imposed.  However, this is not guaranteed to work yet for all stages.  Also, user input concerning directionality of the stage might be needed, since this information cannot always be learned from the hardware.
