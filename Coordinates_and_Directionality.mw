== '''Coordinates and Directionality in Micro-Manager''' ==

To assure that movement of stages and the orientation of images is as you expect, microscope acquisition software needs to have information about the direction of motion of stages and image orientation.  In Micro-Manager, we attempt to overcome confusion about directionality by mandating a single coordinate system.  The 'Micro-Manager' coordinate system uses micrometers as its unit, and places the origin (0,0) in the top left corner for XY stages (when viewed from above, this holds true for both inverted and upright microscopes).  Positive movement along the X-axis moves the stage to the left, positive movement along the Y-axis moves the stage to the top (away from the observer). This coordinate system follows that of SBS multi-well plate, with (for a 96 well plate) well A1 in the top left corner and well H12 in the bottom right corner (in the Micro-Manager coordinate system, well A1 will have low X and Y coordinates, and well H12 will have high X and Y coordinates).

It is the task of the stage adapter to guarantee that this coordinate system is imposed.  However, this is not guaranteed to work yet for all stages.  Also, user input concerning directionality of the stage might be needed, since this information cannot always be learned from the hardware. To check that the stage moves in the correct orientation, you can execute the following (one line) script in the Micro-Manager script panel:<br>
mmc.setRelativeXYPosition(mmc.getXYStageDevice(), 1000, 1000);<br>
This should move the stage by 1 mm to the left, away from the observer.  

Z-Stages (Focus stages) will have their lowest values away from the sample (at the lowest point for inverted scopes and the highest point of upright scopes).  Movement in the positive direction will move the objective lens towards the sample.  This directionality should be guaranteed by the device adapter, however, as of now (version 1.2.15) this has not been verified for any focus drive adapter.  The following script should move the focus drive by 1 mm towards the sample (make sure that the objective is far enough away from the sample before executing this command!):<br>
mmc.setRelativePosition(mmc.getFocusDevice(), 1000);
