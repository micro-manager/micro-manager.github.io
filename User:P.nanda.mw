I have been a Support Engineer for Andor Technology since 2008.  I worked in the camera division for a year and since then have been working in microscopy division in the dual role of field technician and remote support.

I'm happy to help µManager users, even though commercial responsibility is limited to driver development and bug fixing.  FLOSS software plays a strong role in empowering my company's customers.

I'm also porting µManager to Gentoo GNU/Linux, since it is the distribution I like to use at home:
