== About ==
My name is Pariksheet Nanda.  I have been a Support Engineer for Andor Technology since 2008.  I worked in the camera/spectroscopy division for a year and since then have been working in microscopy division in the dual role of field technician and remote support.  I have a hardware background and spend most of my time helping users.

== Interest in µManager ==
# Setup µManager to add software choice for running microscopy systems
# Improve documentation on this wiki, specifically to:
#* Update DeviceAdapter and general knowledge pages
#* Reduce the work involved to contribute code
# Get familiar with the programming API
# Add GNU/Linux packages to official µManager releases.  I want the project to be recognized on the [http://directory.fsf.org/wiki?title=Review:Micro-Manager-REV-ID-1&redirect=no FSF Directory] to have more visibility, and attract programmers and funding from other industries.  I maintain a repository for installing µManager on Gentoo GNU/Linux: https://github.com/omsai/micromanager-overlay

== Current projects ==
# Add sequence exposure support for Andor cameras using [http://www.andor.com/learning-academy/trigger-modes-ixon-ultra-and-ixon3-trigger-modes Andor's iCam feature]
#* Code: https://github.com/omsai/micromanager/tree/sequence_exposure
# Support CMake to build and release µManager, as a better platform independent solution build system (collaborating with Michael Curtis):
#* Wiki: https://github.com/omsai/micromanager/wiki
#* Code: https://github.com/omsai/micromanager/tree/cmake

== Maintenance ==
These are the wiki pages I maintain:
* [[Andor]]
* [[AndorSDK3]]
* [[AndorLaserCombiner]]
* [[Arduino]]
* [[Comparison with other microscopy software]]
* [[Setup UTSW SD]]
