== About ==
My name is Pariksheet Nanda.  I have been a Support Engineer for Andor Technology since 2008.  I worked in the camera/spectroscopy division for a year and since then have been working in microscopy division in the dual role of field technician and remote support.  I have a hardware background and spend most of my time writing documentation and helping users.

== Interest in µManager ==
# Improve documentation on this wiki.
# Setup µManager to give users freedom running their complex imaging microscopes.
# Promote the project to attract programmers and funding from other industries:  particularly by adding GNU/Linux packages to official µManager releases and the [http://directory.fsf.org/wiki?title=Review:Micro-Manager-REV-ID-1&redirect=no FSF Directory].
# Get more familiar with the programming API.

I wish to thank a few super-users for practical information about running µManager:
