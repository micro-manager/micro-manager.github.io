I am currently a PhD student in the laboratory of Dr. Gabriela Popescu in the Biochemistry Dept. of the State University of New York at Buffalo.
I am working to understand NMDA Receptor functional properties using electrophysiological, computational, and microscopic approaches. I am seeking to establish MicroManager as our lab's software for performing Ca2+ imaging experiments.
