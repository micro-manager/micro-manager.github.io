The following instructions for debugging Micro-Manager's Java code with NetBeans are intended to work on Windows or Mac. This is largely identical to the instructions for developing the Java code in 1.4.

(See also: [[Writing plugins for Micro-Manager]])

# Download and install a recent Micro-Manager nightly build. We will refer to the installed Micro-Manager directory as <code>$INSTALLDIR</code> below.
<!--
-->
# Use [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] to download a copy of the latest [http://micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager_Source_Code Micro-Manager source]. We'll refer to the root source directory as <code>$SRCDIR</code> below.<!--
-->
# Download, install and run [http://netbeans.org NetBeans]. The Java SE Bundle is sufficient if you already have the JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your computer. Otherwise, you can install the JDK and NetBeans at the same time from [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/ Oracle's JDK download page].
<!--
-->
# Choose '''File''' > '''New Project...''' >  [Categories] '''Java''' > [Projects] '''Java Project with Existing Sources'''. Press '''Next'''.
<!--
-->
# Give your project a name. The '''Project Folder''' is best saved outside of the Micro-Manager source directory. Press '''Next'''.
<!--
-->
# Under '''Source Package Folders''', click '''Add Folder''' at right and browse to <code>$SRCDIR/mmstudio/src</code>. If you want to develop a plugin, you can also add <code>$SRCDIR/plugins/*/src</code> at this time. Press '''Next'''.
<!--
-->
# Include all files ('''**'''). Press '''Finish'''.
<!--
-->
# Right-click your project in the '''Projects''' tab (probably at left) and select '''Properties'''.
<!--
-->
# Select '''Libraries''' under '''Categories'''. Make sure the '''Java Platform''' matches the version of Micro-Manager you are using (e.g., 64-bit JDK 1.6 - but using a newer Java Platform in NetBeans than the one shipped with Micro-Manager is usually okay).
<!--
-->
# Under '''Compile''' > '''Compile-time Libraries''', click '''Add Jar/Folder''' and add <code>$INSTALLDIR/ij.jar</code>, as well as  all jars in <code>$INSTALLDIR/plugins/Micro-Manager</code> ''except for'' <code>MMJ_.jar</code>.
<!--
-->
# Select '''Run''' under '''Categories'''. For the <default config>, set the following parameters:
<!--
-->
#* '''Main Class:'''  type in <code>ij.ImageJ</code>
<!--
-->
#* '''Working Directory:''' type in your <code>$INSTALLDIR</code>
<!--
-->
#* '''VM options:''' for 64 bit systems, type in <code>-Xmx3000M</code>, otherwise use <code>-Xmx600M</code>. This sets the maximum memory (megabytes) used by Java.
<!--
-->
# Click '''OK''', and then right-click your project and choose '''Debug'''. If all is well, then Micro-Manager should launch inside ImageJ.

{{Note|The components from the installed Micro-Manager can get out of sync with the Subversion source. If you encounter unexpected errors, update to the latest nightly build and the latest source revision.}}
