At Kairos Instruments, my partner, Doug Koebler, builds stage top incubators and devices up to complete automated imaging systems.  I help support customers / clients doing biomedical research involving live-cell imaging, currently with focus on HIF expression and hypoxia.  Doug and I have about 20 years experience working together, formerly with Automated Cell, Inc, a start-up that failed.
