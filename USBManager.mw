This adapter provides an interface to certain USB devices.  It makes these devices visible to other device adapters as if they were behind a normal (RS232) serial port.  Currently, this only works with the Velleman K8055, K8061, and Nikon AZ100.  On Windows, the user needs to install the appropriate driver (see [[K8055]], [[K8061]], or [[NikonAZ100]] ).  On other platforms, this may not be the case.
