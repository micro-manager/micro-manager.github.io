I am an engineering scientist based in Wollongong. Australia (around 60 miles south of Sydney) working on a Phase Contrast Microscope project.  My particular interest is in measuring 'grey levels' of Phase Contrast images, preferably live, so as to optimise focus of nearly invisible phase objects for photography.  Otherwise, automatic measurement of grey levels and of the difference between maximum and minimum on recorded images would be a reasonable compromise.
