This page is a brief tutorial to build a very simple circuit to control laser shutters, using an Arduino board.
In this particular case, there are two shutters, coupled with two [[Cobolt]] lasers (belonging to Micro-Manager [[Device_Support|supported devices]]), so is possible to facilitate use of lasers with a GUI panel, generated by a [[Script_Panel_GUI|Beanshell script]].
The following procedure is generally useful to build a circuit with two BNC connectors, in order to supply HIGH/LOW voltage state to TTL devices.

The software GUI panel for control easily laser power and shutter can be found in [[Cobolt]] laser subsection [[GUI panel for Cobolt laser control]].

For circuit, the following materials are required:

-An Arduino board;

-1 A/B USB cable (to connect Arduino board);

-2 BNC connectors;

-3 wires (which length must be enough to go from Arduino board to laser shutters), of different color to make easy their recognition (I choose 2 red for positive voltage and black for ground);

-1 connector block.
