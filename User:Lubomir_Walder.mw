I am a software developer working for Roper Engineering s.r.o, a private company located in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Our company is a subsidiary of Roper Industries. For about three years I've been assigned to work for Photometrics/QImaging, mostly doing new implementations, bugfixing and support for QCam and PVCAM API.

The MicroManager is starting to gain importance in our company and we are getting requests from our marketing and sales team to implement new features to PVCAM adapter. However such tasks are still quite low priority to us so we unfortunately often cannot quickly react to user requests or fix bugs immediately.

Hereby I'd like to request an access to PVCAM and QCam section of your wiki page so we can update it with relevant information whenever we make significant changes mentioned adapters.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact myself on provided email address or our software manager Bhaskar Srinivasan at bsrinivasan@photometrics.com.


Thank you.
