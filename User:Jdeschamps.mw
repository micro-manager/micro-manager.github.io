PhD student at EMBL (Germany) in the group of Jonas Ries. The group uses localization microscopy to decipher the structural organisation of protein complexes in yeast. I focus on the development of cutting edge microscopes. In particular, I am interested in automated localization microscopy, adaptive optics and 3D single-molecule methods.
