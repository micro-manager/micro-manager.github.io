== Overview ==

This plugin exists to facilitate alignment and use of [http://dispim.org the diSPIM system], in all of its various forms (including iSPIM).

A much broader overview and further information is available on the diSPIM website, [http://dispim.org dispim.org]

== Plugin Documentation ==

The plugin documentation is now is on the diSPIM wiki at [http://dispim.org dispim.org].  An older, no longer updated, version is in the the [http://www.asiimaging.com/downloads/manuals/diSPIM_Manual.pdf diSPIM manual] on ASI's website.

== Change Log ==
List of significant changes since 1.4.19 release, omitting bug fixes.  The feature was fully implemented as of the nightly build listed.

* 20150925: significantly expanded autofocus options
* 20150811: autofocus during timelapse, rapid-fire (hardware-timed) acquisition
* (1.4.21 release)
* 20150428: autofocus to define calibration (not yet during timelapse)
* 20150415: added basic stage scanning (contact ASI for firmware if needed)
* 20150225: added hardware switching for multi-channel using Tiger's PLC
* 20150113: added multi-position support and software-based multi-channel support
* (1.4.20 release)
* 20141219: added ability to easily do offset-only calibration adjustment
* 20141215: improved slice timing calculations including speeding up optimized easy timing slice period by 0.25 ms
* 20141209: added colored status indicators for "quick glance" position information (helpful esp. to avoid manual alignment when not centered)
* 20141207: added ability to export data for Fiji Multiview plugin
* (1.4.19 release)

== Known Issues ==

* Camera timing calculations assume CameraLink interface speeds.  If you are using a USB3 interface the timing may be different, so if you are missing frames uncheck "minimize slice period" and increase the slice period manually.

== Please contact us! ==

The plugin is quite usable in its current state but we welcome ideas for future improvements as well as bug reports.  You can contact us directly or else by submitting a bug report via Micro-manager.

Before submitting bug reports, please check a recent nightly build of Micro-Manager to make sure the bug hasn't been already fixed. Also, sometimes fixes are made to firmware, so you can update that if needed.

To update the firmware, [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/31csgbyubwvqq8y/AADX5LLUYZpXKZ1dtJQRcVQta?dl=0 download the latest firmware package].  Firmware should work for diSPIM systems sold 2014 or later if you and load TigerComm.hex on card address 0/30 and other card numbers with the firmware filenames, omitting any cards your controller doesn't have.  If you are upgrading from pre-3.00 firmware then the piezo range(s) will need to be set to match the hardware using the PR command (e.g. "PR P=4 Q=4" for 200um piezo range, see the [http://www.asiimaging.com/downloads/manuals/Tiger%20ADEPT%20user%20manual.pdf manual]); in firmware version 3.00 and later the piezo range is stored in a way not affected by firmware updates.
