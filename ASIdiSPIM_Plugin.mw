The plugin documentation currently resides as part of the [http://www.asiimaging.com/downloads/manuals/diSPIM_Manual.pdf diSPIM manual] available on the ASI website.

== Significant Changes ==
List of significant changes since 1.4.19 release, omitting bug fixes.  The feature was fully implemented as of the nightly build listed.

* 20141215: improved slice timing calculations including speeding up optimized easy timing slice period by 0.25ms
* 20141209: added colored status indicators for "quick glance" position information (helpful esp. to avoid manual alignment when not centered)

== Please contact us! ==

The plugin is quite usable in its current state but we welcome ideas for future improvements as well as bug reports.
