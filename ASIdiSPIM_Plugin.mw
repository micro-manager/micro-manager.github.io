== Overview ==

This plugin exists to facilitate alignment and use of [http://dispim.org the diSPIM system], in all of its various forms (including iSPIM).

A much broader overview and further information is available on the diSPIM website, [http://dispim.org dispim.org]

== Plugin Documentation ==

The plugin documentation is now is on the diSPIM wiki at [http://dispim.org dispim.org].  An older, no longer updated, version is in the the [http://www.asiimaging.com/downloads/manuals/diSPIM_Manual.pdf diSPIM manual] on ASI's website.

== Change Log ==
List of significant changes since 1.4.19 release, omitting bug fixes.  The feature was fully implemented as of the nightly build listed.

* 20151125: added ImageJ toolset for common image manipulation tasks
* 20151124: ability to run test acquisition with optionally exported raw file
* 20151013: added API calls to change acquisition settings programmatically
* 20150925: significantly expanded autofocus options
* 20150819: buttons to raise/lower SPIM head and sync upper and lower Z axes
* (1.4.22 release)
* 20150811: autofocus during timelapse
* 20150807: rapid-fire (hardware-timed) acquisition
* (1.4.21 release)
* 20150428: autofocus to define calibration (not yet during timelapse)
* 20150415: added basic stage scanning (contact ASI for firmware if needed)
* 20150225: added hardware switching for multi-channel using Tiger's PLC
* 20150113: added multi-position support and software-based multi-channel support
* (1.4.20 release)
* 20141219: added ability to easily do offset-only calibration adjustment
* 20141215: improved slice timing calculations including speeding up optimized easy timing slice period by 0.25 ms
* 20141209: added colored status indicators for "quick glance" position information (helpful esp. to avoid manual alignment when not centered)
* 20141207: added ability to export data for Fiji Multiview plugin (as of April 2015 the Fiji plugin can directly import data without requiring this step)
* (1.4.19 release)

== Known Issues ==

* Camera timing calculations assume CameraLink interface speeds.  If you are using a USB3 interface the timing may be different, so if you are missing frames uncheck "minimize slice period" and increase the slice period manually.

== Please contact us! ==

The plugin is quite usable in its current state but we welcome ideas for future improvements as well as bug reports.  You can contact us directly or else by submitting a bug report via Micro-manager.

Before submitting bug reports, please check a recent nightly build of Micro-Manager to make sure the bug hasn't been already fixed. Also, sometimes fixes are made to firmware, so you can update that if needed.

For instructions on updating the controller firmware see http://dispim.org/hardware/controller.
