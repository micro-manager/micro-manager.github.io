== Overview ==

This plugin exists to facilitate alignment and use of [http://dispim.org the diSPIM system], in all of its various forms (including iSPIM).

== Plugin Documentation ==

The plugin documentation currently resides as part of the [http://www.asiimaging.com/downloads/manuals/diSPIM_Manual.pdf diSPIM manual] available on the ASI website.

== Change Log ==
List of significant changes since 1.4.19 release, omitting bug fixes.  The feature was fully implemented as of the nightly build listed.

* (1.4.21 release)
* 20150428: autofocus to define calibration (not yet during timelapse)
* 20150415: added basic stage scanning (contact ASI for firmware if needed)
* 20150225: added hardware switching for multi-channel using Tiger's PLC
* 20150113: added multi-position support and software-based multi-channel support
* (1.4.20 release)
* 20141219: added ability to easily do offset-only calibration adjustment
* 20141215: improved slice timing calculations including speeding up optimized easy timing slice period by 0.25ms
* 20141209: added colored status indicators for "quick glance" position information (helpful esp. to avoid manual alignment when not centered)
* 20141207: added ability to export data for Fiji Multiview plugin

== Please contact us! ==

The plugin is quite usable in its current state but we welcome ideas for future improvements as well as bug reports.  You can contact us directly or else by submitting a bug report via Micro-manager.

Before submitting bug reports, please check a recent nightly build of Micro-Manager to make sure the bug hasn't been already fixed. Also, sometimes fixes are made to firmware, so you can update that if needed.

To update the firmware, download the latest firmware package at http://www.asiimaging.com/downloads/manuals/latest%20diSPIM%20firmware.zip.  Firmware should work for diSPIM systems sold 2014 or later if you and load TigerComm.hex on card address 0/30 and other card numbers with the firmware filenames, omitting any cards your controller doesn't have.  If you are upgrading from pre-3.00 firmware then the piezo range(s) will need to be set to match the hardware using the PR command (e.g. "PR P=4 Q=4" for 200um piezo range, see the [http://www.asiimaging.com/downloads/manuals/Tiger%20ADEPT%20user%20manual.pdf manual]); in firmware version 3.00 and later the piezo range is stored in a way not affected by firmware updates.
