pgFocus is an open source and open hardware focus stabilization device developed by Karl Bellvé at the Biomedical Imaging Group (PMM, University of Massachusetts Medical School).

The pg in pgFocus is short for "Pretty Good". pgFocus isn't "Perfect", or "Definite" but it is pretty good!

pgFocus is designed to track and control focus within ±3nM at 30Hz under optimal conditions. 


Movie, [[Media:pgFocus.mov]], of pgFocus in action. 200nM beads were TIRF imaged in burst mode with a 60X objective with a 1.6X optivar. 

The microscope is enclosed in an environmental chamber. The doors to the chamber were opened at image 300 and closed at image 600. You will see a disturbance to the focus at both times, but focus is soon corrected within moments.
