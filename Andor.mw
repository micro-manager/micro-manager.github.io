Andor has greatly reworked this adapter (as of Micro-Manager version 1.1.44) and tested the adapter with iXon, Luca-S and Luca-R cameras.  They have also added support for the 'traditional' (non-EM) read-out mode and for iCam features in the camera, which allows for much more rapid switching of exposure times than previously possible. To use the iCam features, you will need a relatively recent camera and you might need to upgrade the firmware of your camera and the PCI card.  Information on how to do this can be found where?

This adapter defines two devices: the actual camera (Ixon) and the shutter in front of the camera (IxonShutter).  The shutter device is depreciated and there is no need to define it in your configuration file.  The shutter can now be controlled as a property of the camera.  For any normal work you likely will want to open the shutter on startup and possibly close it again on program shutdown, this is most easily accomplished by setting this property in the 'System'-'Startup' and 'System'-'Shutdown' configuration groups.

The adapter needs to know the location of the Andor driver.  Type in the full path to the Andor directory (default: C:\Program Files\Andor) in the Hardware configuration wizard.

The offset in the Ixon camera only rises higher than 0 when the temperature is lower than -50C (I am not sure if this is the case for all cameras), so make sure that the temperature of the camera (a read-only property that can be seen in the device/property browser) is below -50C (or preferably at -70C or lower).  

Other software packages take care to bring up the temperature of the camera gradually after shutting down the software.  We have been told by Andor that this is not necessary and do not have provisions for gradual warmup back to RT.

This camera has two gains, EM and 'normal' gain.  EM gain is currently called 'gain', as opposed to 'amplifier-gain'.
