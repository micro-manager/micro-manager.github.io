This adapter interfaces with Prior hardware through the ProScan and OptiScan controllers.  It communicates with the controller through the serial port so that no further software is needed.  It works with the Prior XYStage, Zstage, filter wheels, shutters, the LumenPro and can also control the TTLs on the Proscan controller.
