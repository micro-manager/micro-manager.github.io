The Arduino32bitBoards device adapter contains extra features compared to the regular [[Arduino]] device adapter.

Currently the Teensy 3.5 is the recommended board to be used with this device adapter, bur there is also firmware available for the teensy 3.2, ESP32 and feather M4.

Differences compared to regular Arduino Device Adapter:
* Two extra output channels to a total of 8
* Added Pulse-width modulation (PWM) control
* Unified DAC and PWM
* Unified digital-out channels and DAC/PWM channels, this allows DAC/PWM blanking on all 8 channels
* Changed unit of DAC/ PWM from "Volt" to "Power %" and the default scale to 0-100
* In the Firmware: Channels 1 - 2 are by default DAC channels, channels 3-8 are by default PWM

==Advantages and Disadvantages of Arduino 32 Bit-boards in general==
Advantages:
* Much faster, because of higher clock speed and more work performed per clockcycle.
* Baudrate increased to 500 000, nearly 9 times the transferspeed between Arduino and Micro-Manager (there are some exceptions). This can be even increased to 2 000 000, with micro-manager 2
* Most 32-bit Arduinos have a build-in DAC (max 3.3V output)
* Higher PWM frequencies and PWM bitresolutions
* More flexibility with pins used

Disadvantages:
*Most are not 5V tolerant, this means you'll need voltage level converter when using the triggerpin. It is recommended to use Teensy 3.5 since this board does have 5V tolerant inputs. When using a not 5V tolerant board it is recommended to use a voltage level converter like this one [https://www.adafruit.com/product/757 link] or this one [https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009 link]

* Library support might not always be great
==Working Arduino boards:==

Firmware code for these boards can be found on [https://github.com/bonnom/Arduino32BitBoards/tree/master/Firmwares Bonno Meddens github repository].

*ESP32
**        Baudrate: 115200
**         DAC1 on pin 25 and DAC2 on pin 26
**         ADC not implemented
**        Able to set PWM frequency and Resolution
**         Low Price boards available
**         KEEP IN MIND: NOT 5V TOLERANT!!

*    ItsyBitsy M4
**         The ADC does not work at the moment because of DAC implementation
**         Channel 8 has become channel 7
**         KEEP IN MIND: NOT 5V TOLERANT!!

*Teensy 3.x Boards
**All 3.x boards

***    Able to set PWM frequency and Resolution, for more information link
***    At least one DAC
***    handy:  [https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/pinout.html Pinouts page]

**Teensy 3.1 & 3.2
***        Seems to work fine, but more testing is needed
***        All currently used pins in the sketch are 5V tolerant
***        Only one DAC on pin A14
***        All other pins are the same as the original UNO firmware

**    Teensy 3.5 (Recommended)
***        Not yet tested
***        All currently used pins in the firmware are 5V tolerant
***        DAC1 on pin 21 and DAC2 on pin 22
***        Able to set PWM frequency and Resolution

**    Teensy 3.6
***        Uses same sketch as teensy 3.5
***        Faster than teensy 3.5
***        KEEP IN MIND: NOT 5V TOLERANT!!

==Boards that do not work with this firmware/device adapter:==

*    Esp8266 board
*    Arduino Due
*    Sipeed Maix boards

==To be tested:==

*Teensy LC
*    A SAMD21 board
*    Teensy 3.5 (Very likely Works)
