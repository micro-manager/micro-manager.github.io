The Slide Explorer plugin works like Google Maps for your microscope. With this plugin you can:

* Develop a map of part or all of the slide in real time.
* Move the field of view to your desired point of interest with a single click.
* Create multiple tiled images with irregular boundaries in 5 dimensions (X, Y, Z, Time, Channel).

The Slide Explorer is available in Micro-Manager 1.3.46 or later. Before using the Slide Explorer, you will need to run the [[Pixel Calibrator Plugin|Pixel Calibrator plugin]]. The size and orientation of pixels measured by the Pixel Calibrator will be used to ensure that the tiles in the Slide Explorer are properly registered.
