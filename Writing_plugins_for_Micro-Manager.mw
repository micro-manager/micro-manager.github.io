Micro-Manager has a plugin system similar to ImageJ's. To write a Micro-Manager plugin, simply implement the [https://valelab.ucsf.edu/svn/micromanager2/branches/micromanager1.3/mmstudio/src/org/micromanager/api/MMPlugin.java <code>MMPlugin</code> interface]. Note the static String <code>menuName</code> lets you control the name of the plugin that appears in the Micro-Manager Plugins menu.

Micro-Manager's classpath is set up so that Micro-Manager plugins can import classes from:
<ol>
<li>the [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/ Java 2 SE 5.0 Libraries]</li>
<li>[https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~arthur/mm_doc/html/namespaces.html Micro-Manager]</li>
<li>[http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/developer/api/ ImageJ]</li>
<li>[http://commons.apache.org/math/userguide/overview.html Apache Commons Math]</li>
</ol>

In addition, you have access to the GUI and core instances (objects) already created by Micro-Manager startup. Micro-Manager will call
<code>public void setApp(ScriptInterface app);</code>
you can get the GUI object and core objects thus:
<pre>
MMStudioMainFrame gui_ = (MMStudioMainFrame) app;
CMMCore core_ = gui_.getMMCore();
</pre>
Micro-Manager distribution includes swing-layout-*.*.jar so that you can use the free Netbeans GUI Builder for your plugin. Make sure you set the "Layout Generation Style" property as explained on the [http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqFormLayoutGenerationStyle Netbeans website].
