I develop image acquisition, processing & analysis microscopy protocols (lightfield and LSCM) for clinical microbiology and pathology departments. Interested in video acquisition. Programmer, linux user.

At this moment I'm trying to build an realtime image analysis software, based on Micromanager and some python image processing libraries.
