I am a postdoc at the labs of Prof. Eric Wieschaus and Prof. Stas Shvartsman, Princeton University. I study tissue organization and cell morphology during drosophila embryogenesis using computational tools, in particular image analysis.
My PhD was at the lab of Prof. Elazar Zelzer, Weizmann institute of science, Israel, where I studied the morphological development of bones in the mouse model.
