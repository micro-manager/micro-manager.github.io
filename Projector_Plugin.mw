-->
Each tab is detailed below.


== Point and Shoot ==

Single region control by clicking on the image.  This toggles micro-mirrors for SLM devices, or fires a single shot for galvo devices.

!style="width: 20%;"| Setting
! Description
|- valign="top"
| On / Off
| Engages <code>Point and Shoot</code> mode.  To prevent accidental use, one has to hold down the <code>Ctrl</code> key and click to activate.
|- valign="top"
| Spot dwell time

== ROIs ==

Multi-region control.  Programs regions to be fired with Multi-Dimensional Acquisition, or fires instantly like <code>Point and Shoot</code> tab using "ROI ROIs now!" button.

{| class="wikitable"
!style="width: 20%;"| Setting
! Description
|- valign="top"
| Set ROI(s)
| Program the device with ROI(s) drawn on the selected image.
|- valign="top"
| ROI Manager
| To add multiple 2D regions on the image, one has to use the ImageJ ROI Manager.  This button is just a shortcut to that ImageJ menu.
|- valign="top"
| Loop
| Number of times to fire ROIs.  This setting differs from the device's <code>Repetitions</code> property by looping after visiting each region.
|- valign="top"
| Spot dwell time
| (Does not affect pulse laser) Stops photo illumination after set time.
|- valign="top"
| Run ROIs now!
| Fires ROIs drawn on current image.
|- valign="top"
| Run ROIs in Multi-Dimensional Acquisition
| Fires phototargeting devices in parallel with MDA (does not affect image capture rate).
|- valign="top"
| Start Frame
| Timepoint in MDA to fire sequence.
|- valign="top"
| Repeat every __ frames
| Timepoint interval in MDA to again fire sequence until MDA completes or device turned off in <code>Setup</code> tab.

== Setup ==

Initial calibration.

{| class="wikitable"
!style="width: 20%;"| Setting
! Description
|- valign="top"
| On / Off
| Toggles device control.
|- valign="top"
| Calibrate
| Creates calibration map of phototargeting device range to the camera pixel position.  Repeat for all cameras and objectives you intend to use with the phototargeting device.
|- valign="top"
| Show center spot
| Illuminate center of SLM or galvo device.
|- valign="top"
| Phototargeting channel
| Toggles to specified channel during phototargeting.  You don't need to set this unless some hardware needs to be moved during imaging, like a dichroic and/or a shutter.  If you don't see your channel listed, you must set the <code>Core-ChannelGroup</code> in the <code>Property Browser</code> to the Group containing this channel.
