== Autofocus Setup ==

Micro-Manager needs to be told which image-based autofocus mechanism to use (even though there is currently only one;).  To do so, save the following in a text file called MMStartup.bsh and save it in your Micro-Manager folder:

--------------- Cut Here ---------------
mmc.logMessage("Processing startup script...");

// load focusing module
response = acq.installAutofocusPlugin("Autofocus_");
mmc.logMessage(response);

mmc.logMessage("Startup script finished.");
--------------- Cut Here ---------------
