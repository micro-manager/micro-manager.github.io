This adapter is an interface to the libdc1394 library [http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/libdc1394/] (included), which controls firewire cameras that adhere to the IIDC specifications [http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/libdc1394/iidc_specifications.php].  Damien Douxchamps maintains a list [http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/cameras/index.php] of compatible cameras.

The adapter was developed using an Apple iSight camera and a Sony XCD-700, so these will likely work decently whereas your mileage might vary with other cameras.  Gregory Jefferis put some work in to make this work with Format 7 cameras (the most powerful video mode format supported by the standard), but I am not exactly sure where that stands.

Many of the IIDC-compatible cameras do not allow you to set an exposure time expressed in msec.  Therefore, the 'shutter' function is being used, the number of which relates in a camera specific way to exposure time. A more elegant solution would be great! 

Color images (like those from the Apple iSight) are converted to gray-scale images within the adapter (useful until the day that Micro-Manager starts supporting color cameras). 

The adapter also implements a software integration feature, which can be useful to improve signal/noise for noisy 8-bit cameras (when integrating the adapter will return a 16-bit image resulting from adding the specified number of consecutive 8-bit images).

The adapter was developed on Mac OS X but was reported to work on linux as well (however, check out the [[Building Firewire camera support on Linux]] build instructions).  libdc1394 is currently being ported to Windows [http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/libdc1394/news.php], so one day we might implement this adapter on Windows as well. 

There is a lot of work that can be done on the adapter to make it auto-detect capabilities of different cameras, switch on and off auto-capabilities of the cameras, etc..  However, it seems useful in many cases already.
