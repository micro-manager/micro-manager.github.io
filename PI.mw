This adapter controls stages connected to PI SCPI Controllers. The SCPI command set was discontinued about 5 years ago and has been replaced by the GCS command set, so this adapter will only work with older controllers.  It has been tested with the E-662 controller but should work with all PI controllers that support SCPI and can be connected via a serial interface.  For current PI controller use the [[PI_GCS]] adapter instead. 

The PI adapter is available since version 1.2.08. 

All communications to devices take place through serial ports. Check the documentation to your controller for the required port settings, however, the default settings most likely work fine.
