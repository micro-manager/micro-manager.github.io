This adapter controls stages connected to PI SCPI Controllers. The SCPI command set was discontinued about 5 years ago and has been replaced by the GCS command set, so this adapter will only work with older controllers.  It has been tested with the E-662 controller but should work with all PI controllers that support SCPI and can be connected via a serial interface.  For current PI controller use the [[PI_GCS]] adapter instead. 

The PI adapter is available since version 1.2.10.

The controller can be set in 'Local' mode (it will listen to the frontpanel, not to the computer), or in 'Remote' mode (it will listen to the computer, not to the front panel).  The 'Interface' property lets you switch between these two modes.  You might want to set this in the 'System' 'Startup' and 'Shutdown' property groups.

All communications to devices take place through serial ports. Check the documentation to your controller for the required port settings, however, the default settings most likely work fine.
