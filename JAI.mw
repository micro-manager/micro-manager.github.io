Instructions apply only to JAI cameras based on the Pleora eBUS interface, such as Apex Series. At this time only Apex Series color cameras with USB interface are supported.

Windows 7 and higher is supported, both 32 and 64-bit/ driver was tested on AP-3200T-USB camera model on Windows 10 with 64-bit version of Micro-manager.

Download and install JAI SDK from [https://www.jai.com/support-software/downloads JAI support page]. Select APEX series eBUS-SDK for JAI, either 64-bit or 32-bit, depending on which version of Micro-manager you intend to use the camera with (64-bit or 32-bit). Installing eBUS-SDK is the only requirement for using Apex Series cameras with Micro-manager.
