The Velleman K8055 (VM110 for a pre-assembled board) is a low cost digital IO board.  It provides 8 digital out and 2 analogue out channels (as well as analogue and digital in - which are not used here) that can be used for things like  TTLs or AOTF control.  A drawback of this board is its relatively slow switching time (~10 ms).  

The adapter uses a modified version of libk8055 (by Sven Lindberg and others) and libusb.  The adapter provides a switch, a shutter, and 2 DAC outputs.  Each of the 2 DACs can be set to a voltage between 0 and 5.0 V.  The switch determines which of the 8 output channels will be active. The switch is a single byte, each bit in this byte sets the corresponding channel (for instance, the value '3' will set channels 1 and 2).  The shutter will switch the active channels on and off.

Please note that to use the digital outs, one need to provide input voltage (5-30V) to the Clamp and Grnd pins on the K8055 board.
