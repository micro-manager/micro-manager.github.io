As of this writing, MM is using the Boost 1.40 release. Download Boost and place it
in your usual third party working directory as follows:  (for example)

/Users/karl/projects/3rdparty

1. Start a terminal session, if this directory is not already a subversion working copy, issue the following command
        svn co -N http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/tags/release .

2. Create a text file called externals_value.definition

3. In that text file put exactly this key + URL: 

         boost http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/tags/release/Boost_1_40_0/

4. In order to create an uncomitted 'externals' definition in your working directory, type exactly the following command

         svn propset svn:externals . -F externals_value.definition
 
5. Still in the 3rdparty directory issue:
         svn up

6. After boost has been downloaded, to build the bjam tool, in the 3rdparty/boost directory issue:
         ./bootstrap.sh

7. Ensure that you've got write access to /usr/local. Then after the bjam.exe tool is built issue:
         ./bjam 

8. The result should be a set of headers in /usr/local/include/boost and a set of libraries in /usr/local/lib/boost
