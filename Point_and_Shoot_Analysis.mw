== Point and Shoot Analysis plugin ==

This plugin was made to analyze data acquired using the [Projector] plugin, specifically data acquired in the "Point and Shoot" mode of this plugin.  To do so, start an MDA with a "live" time-lapse (i.e. 0 interval between time points), and bleach objects as you please.  Bleach positions and time points are stored in a file in the "Log Directory".  Copy this file to a safe place to be used in this analysis plugin.
