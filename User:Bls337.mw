I'm a computer scientist interested in the intersection between biology and mathematics. I'm interested in leveraging the power of the GPU to solve problems in microscopy using parallel computing. I have an interest in image processing and computer vision as a result of my background in computer graphics. I look forward to contributing to the Micro-Manager community.
