== Installation ==

Make sure the USB cable is connected, and that the module is powered up.

To install the CoolLED, one has to choose the preciseExcite device.  This is because CoolLED's original product was known as precisExcite and Micro-Manager still knows it by the preciseExcite name.

No installation is required on Mac OS X, since it already has a driver that will recognize the virtual serial port.

No installation is required on Linux, since it already has a driver that will recognize the virtual serial port.  The port can usually be found in /dev/serial/by-id

On Windows:
* Download the file CoolLED-pE-inf.zip from here: [http://www.coolled.com www.coolled.com] and unzip the <code>CoolLED-pE.inf</code> and <code>.cat</code> files. You may need to ask CoolLED for access to the download area.
* In the <code>Device Manager</code>, the CoolLED will appear under <code>Other Devices > CoolLED USB ...</code> with a yellow exclamation mark in the device icon.
* To install your unzipped INF file, in the <code>Device Manager</code>, right-click on <code>CoolLED USB ... > Update Driver Software > Browse my computer for driver software</code>.  Set the location to the place you unzipped the INF file.
* On successful installation, the device will show up as <code>CoolLED USB Virtual Serial Port</code>.

pE-1 and pE-2 have one such port. pE-300 and pE-4000 have two Virtual Serial Ports on the one USB connection.

== Device Configuration ==

In the <code>Hardware Configuration Wizard</code> (under the Micro-Manager <code>Tools</code> menu):
* In Step 2, add the <code>PrecisExcite</code> device and choose the appropriate COM Port.  The default COM port settings (baud rate, etc) will work.
* In Step 3, you may want to set the <code>Default Shutter</code> to the <code>precisExcite</code>.
* You may also want to enable the <code>Auto shutter</code> checkbox is so that it automatically opens during a "Snap" or "Acquisition" and close immediately afterwards.

<!-- It would be nice if this sequencing paragraph was explained in more detail.  It may be obsolete since if it was written for MM 1.3 -->
The <code>Trigger</code> and <code>TriggerSequence</code> properties can be used for external triggering by TTL pulses. In the trigger sequence, channels are labeled "A", "B", "C", "D", and a pause is denoted by "0" (zero).
