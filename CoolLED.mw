CoolLED's original product was known as precisExcite and at present the Micro-Manage software still knows it by that name.

== Installation ==

On Windows, install the [http://www.coolled.com/downloads/distributor/CoolLED-pEx-driver.zip INF driver file] (Mac OS X already has a driver that will recognize the virtual serial port).

Make sure the USB cable is connected, and that the module is powered up.

== Device Configuration ==

In the <code>Hardware Configuration Wizard</code> (under the Micro-Manager <code>Tools</code> menu), choose the appropriate COM Port in Step 2 and add the <code>PrecisExcite</code> device in Step 3.

You may want to choose the <code>precisExcite</code> as the default shutter. This means that when "Auto shutter" is selected in the main window, it will
automatically open (with the current channel and intensity
settings) during a "Snap" or "Acquisition" and close immediately
afterwards.

<!-- It would be nice if this sequencing paragraph was explained in more detail. -->
The <code>Trigger</code> and <code>TriggerSequence</code> properties can be used for external triggering by TTL pulses. In the trigger sequence, channels are labeled "A", "B", "C", "D", and a pause is denoted by "0" (zero).
