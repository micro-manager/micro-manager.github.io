<p>
CoolLED's original product was known as precisExcite and at present the Micro-Manage software still knows it by that name. The names of the current current products controlled by this driver are pE-1, pE-2 and pE-Integrator.
</p>

<p>
On Windows, first make sure the driver is installed (CoolLED-pEx.inf).
(Mac OS X already has a driver that will recognize the virtual serial port.)
Next, make sure the USB cable is connected, and that the module is powered up.
Then in the Hardware Configuration Wizard (under the Micro-Manager Tools menu),
choose the appropriate Com Port in Step 2 and add the PrecisExcite device in Step 3.
</p>

<p>
precisExcite can be chosen as the default Shutter. This means that
when "Auto shutter" is selected in the main window, it will
automatically turn on (with the current channel and intensity
settings) during a "Snap" or "Acquisition" and turn off immediately
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
The Trigger and TriggerSequence properties can be used for external triggering by TTL pulses.
In the trigger sequence, channels are labeled "A","B","C","D", and a pause is denoted by "0" (zero).
