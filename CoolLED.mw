CoolLED's original product was known as precisExcite and at present the Micro-Manage software still knows it by that name.

== Installation ==

Make sure the USB cable is connected, and that the module is powered up.

Mac OS X already has a driver that will recognize the virtual serial port)

On Windows:
* Download the [http://www.coolled.com/downloads/distributor/CoolLED-pEx-driver.zip INF driver] and unzip the <code>CoolLED-pEx.inf</code> file.
* In the <code>Device Manager</code>, the CoolLED will appear under <code>Other Devices > preciseExcite</code> with a yellow exclamation mark in the device icon.
* To install your unzipped INF file, in the <code>Device Manager</code>, right-click on <code>preciseExcite > Update Driver Software > Browse my computer for driver software</code>.  Set the location to the place you unzipped the INF file.
* On successful installation, the device will show up as <code>pEx USB COM Port</code>.

== Device Configuration ==

In the <code>Hardware Configuration Wizard</code> (under the Micro-Manager <code>Tools</code> menu):
* In Step 2, add the <code>PrecisExcite</code> device and choose the appropriate COM Port.
* In Step 3, you may want to set the <code>Default Shutter</code> to the <code>precisExcite</code>.
* You may also want to enable the <code>Auto shutter</code> checkbox is so that it automatically opens during a "Snap" or "Acquisition" and close immediately afterwards.

<!-- It would be nice if this sequencing paragraph was explained in more detail.  It may be obsolete since if it was written for MM 1.3 -->
The <code>Trigger</code> and <code>TriggerSequence</code> properties can be used for external triggering by TTL pulses. In the trigger sequence, channels are labeled "A", "B", "C", "D", and a pause is denoted by "0" (zero).
