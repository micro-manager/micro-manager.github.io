== Installation ==

=== Photometrics ===
This adapter should work with all Photometrics PVCAM compatible camera on all platforms.  To use it, you will need to have the  ([http://www.photometrics.com/support/downloads/index.php PVCAM software]) installed and working. At the very least, the pvcam test application (included with PVCAM) should give you an image, and preferably RSImage works with your camera (although we have seen cases where Micro-Manager works with a PVCAM camera whereas RSImage does not). We tested it with an old MicroMax, a newer Firewire CoolSnap, Cascade II, and Evolve cameras on Windows and a Firewire Coolsnap ES, EZ, and HQ2 on Intel Mac.  Thanks to Ji Yu, most available camera properties are exposed.  To use the adapter on Mac OS X, you will need at least version 2.7.7 of PVCAM (older versions will lock up your Mac). 


== Firewire issues ==

From the Photometrics website:

<blockquote>
In recent updates, Microsoft released two hotfixes which updated their FireWire stack file.
However, these updates cause performance drops in the  functionality of Texas Instruments
(TI) FireWire Controllers which ship with Photometrics cameras. These performance drops
 manifest with the following symptoms:
* Image Tearing
* Interference Lines
* Black Images
* Reduced Frames-per-second
Installing the Thesycon 1394 stack fixes these problems by replacing the default Microsoft stack. This remedies any problems caused by the updates.
The Thesycon FireWire stack has been thoroughly tested and does not cause any other conflicts or problems with any devices.
</blockquote>
The Thesycon stack installer can be downloaded [http://www.photomet.com/support/downloads/index.php here].

== Windows 7 issue ==

Paul Forscher reported that Micro-Manager does not find any PVCAM cameras under Windows 7.  The problem is that Micro-Manager can not find the file 'PVCAM.ini'.  To fix this, run RSConfig.exe from the Photometrics folder in the start menu. This will create the proper PVCam. Ini in the c:\windows folder.  If that fails, type 'cmd' in the "Search programs and files' box in the Start menu, and then type: 

copy C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Windows\PVCAM.ini C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager1.3

where you should replace 'username' with your username.  Note that the directory 'Appdata' is not visible to the Windows file explorer.
