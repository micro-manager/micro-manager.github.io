This adapter should work with all PVCAM compatible camera on all platforms.  To use it, you will need to have the  ([http://www.photomet.com/support/downloads/index.php PVCAM software]) installed and working. At the very least, the pvcam test application (included with PVCAM) should give you an image, and preferably RSImage works with your camera (although we have seen cases where Micro-Manager works with a PVCAM camera whereas RSImage does not). We tested it with an old MicroMax, a newer Firewire CoolSnap, Cascade II, and Evolve cameras on Windows and a Firewire Coolsnap ES, EZ, and HQ2 on Intel Mac.  Thanks to Ji Yu, most available camera properties are exposed.  To use the adapter on Mac OS X, you will need at least version 2.7.7 of PVCAM (older versions will lock up your Mac). 

This adapter will also work with Princeton Instrument (PI) cameras that work with PVCAM.  Be aware that you will need to install the [http://www.princetoninstruments.com/support/software.aspx PI version for PVCAM]. 

If you encounter the following error message on startup:
''Error code: 39<br>''
''Line 14: Property,Core,Initialize,1<br>''
''Error code: 22<br>''
''Device Undefined. Duplicate property names are not allowed.<br>''
then Micro-Manager was most likely not terminated in a graceful way during the previous session.  Simply quit Micro-Manager, reboot your camera (by switching it off and back on again) and try again.
