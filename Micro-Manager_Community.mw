Our mailing list is hosted on [http://sourceforge.net SourceForge]. You can use it to ask questions to the Micro-Manager developers and other users, and provide comments and suggestions. We also use the mailing list to announce new releases. The list has a volume of about 150 mails per month. The archives of the list might already contain the answer to your question.
