Bioengineer and PhD Candidate at the University of Pittsburgh studying Computational Modeling and Simulation. Looking to  write plugins for MM to assist my labâ€™s mission in the study of morphogenesis and the biophysical drivers involved. Have been working on writing for MM 1.4 and seek to assist in keeping documentation up to date to improve accessibility for all users.
