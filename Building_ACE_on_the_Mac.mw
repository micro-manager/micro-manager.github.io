Download ACE (from [http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/ here]) version 5.6.1 (be sure to get the 'full' version, you only need ACE), or possibly later.

Unpack in a logical place (for instance: /usr/local/src, use bunzip2 and tar -xvf to unpack a .tar.bz2 file)

Follow the build instructions ([http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/DOC_ROOT/ACE/ACE-INSTALL.html#aceinstall download here]) for a traditional build.  The autotools build is heavily broken on the Mac.

For example:

cd into ACE_Wrappers

<nowiki>ACE_ROOT=`pwd`; export ACE_ROOT</nowiki>ACE_ROOT=`pwd`; export ACE_ROOT


Create and edit $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h
On Tiger (10.4) it should read:

<nowiki>
#define ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER

#include "ace/config-macosx-tiger.h"
</nowiki>

Create a build configuration file, $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU
On Tiger (10.4) it should read:

<nowiki>
debug = 1
shared_libs = 0
static_libs = 1
include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_macosx_tiger.GNU<br>
</nowiki>

If you wish to build ACE as a shared library, you would need to change this and also define DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to include $(ACE_ROOT)/lib

Now cd into $(ACE_ROOT)/ace and type make

To make the library available to your system, place a symbolic link in /usr/local/include that points to the $(ACE_ROOT)/ace directory:<br>
sudo ln -s $(ACE_ROOT)/ace /usr/local/include/ace

Copy libACE.a to /usr/local/lib
