Download  [http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/ ACE] version 5.6.1, or possibly later (be sure to get the 'full' version, you only need ACE, no TAO).

Unpack in a logical place (for instance: /usr/local/src) use bunzip2 and tar -xvf to unpack the .tar.bz2 file.

ACE has an autotools build mechanism, and a 'traditional' build.  The autotools build worked with ACE version 5.5 on the Mac, but has been broken since.  To use the 'traditional' build follow the  [http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/DOC_ROOT/ACE/ACE-INSTALL.html#aceinstall build instructions].

For example:

cd into ACE_Wrappers and type:

<code>ACE_ROOT=`pwd`; export ACE_ROOT</code>


Create and edit $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h
On Tiger (10.4) it should read:

<code><pre>
#define ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER
#include "ace/config-macosx-tiger.h"
</pre></code>


Create a build configuration file, $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU
On Tiger (10.4) it should read:

<code><pre>
debug = 1
shared_libs = 0
static_libs = 1
include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_macosx_tiger.GNU
</pre></code>


If you wish to build ACE as a shared library, you would need to change this and also define DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to include $(ACE_ROOT)/lib

Now cd into $(ACE_ROOT)/ace, type make and pray no errors will occur.

To make the library available to your system, place a symbolic link in /usr/local/include that points to the $(ACE_ROOT)/ace directory:<br>
<code>sudo ln -s $(ACE_ROOT)/ace /usr/local/include/ace</code>

Copy libACE.a to /usr/local/lib
