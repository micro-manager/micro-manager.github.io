Serial port settings are 115200 baud, no parity, 1 stop bit, no handshaking (for both RS-232 and USB).

If you run into problems please contact the author at the address above.

NB: there is a separate device adapter, [[ASIStage]], for stand-alone MS-2000 controllers or older rack-mount controllers.

For TG-1000 systems the build-in USB connection is actually a USB to serial converter. You can find drivers for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux at the [http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx Silicon labs website].  This is the same as used for recent ASI 'WK' or 'Whizkid' controllers.

Property Notes
* SerialCommand: By default the command is sent only sent when a change is made; to resend same command you can add a space; change the property "OnlySendSerialCommandOnChange" property to "No" to change this behavior.  This is due to the behavior of Micro-manager often refreshing the property values which can cause the command to be sent multiple times.


==Known limitations==
* CRISP supported was added 25-Sep-2013.  Use requires both a Micro-manager build and card firmware after that date.
* LED illuminator support was added 20-May-2014.  Use requires both a Micro-manager build and card firmware after that date.
* TTL-triggered piezo sequences are not yet supported, but will be added upon request (contact the author).
