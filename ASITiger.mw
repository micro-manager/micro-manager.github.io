Property Notes
* SerialCommand: By default the command is sent only sent when a change is made; to resend same command you can add a space; change the property "OnlySendSerialCommandOnChange" property to "No" to change this behavior



'''Known limitations:'''
* CRISP supported was added 25-Sep-2013.  Besides requiring a Micro-manager build after that date, it also requires card firmware after that date.
* Shutter control is currently not supported.  It may be possible to control with the stand-alone CRISP device adapter.  The author will add support on request.
* TTL-triggered piezo sequences not yet supported due to lack of firmware support.
