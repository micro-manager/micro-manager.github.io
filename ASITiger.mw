This adapter is not intended for stand-alone MS-2000 and WK-2000 controllers or older rack-mount controllers, just for TG-1000 systems.


'''Known limitations:'''
* CRISP supported was added 25-Sep-2013.  Besides requiring a Micro-manager build after that date, it also requires card firmware after that date.
* Shutter control is currently not supported.  It may be possible to control with the stand-alone CRISP device adapter.  The author will add support on request.
* TTL-triggered sequences not yet supported due to lack of firmware support on TIGER.
