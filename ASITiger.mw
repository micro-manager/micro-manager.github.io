Property Notes
* SerialCommand: By default the command is sent only sent when a change is made; to resend same command you can add a space; change the property "OnlySendSerialCommandOnChange" property to "No" to change this behavior.  This is due to the behavior of Micro-manager often refreshing the property values which can cause the command to be sent multiple times.


==Known limitations==
* CRISP supported was added 25-Sep-2013.  Use requires both a Micro-manager build and card firmware after that date.
* LED illuminator support was added 20-May-2014.  Use requires both a Micro-manager build and card firmware after that date.
* TTL-triggered piezo sequences are not yet supported, but will be added upon request (contact the author).
