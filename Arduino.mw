The [http://www.arduino.cc/ Arduino] is a low cost programmable digital IO board.  It has some digital inputs and digital outputs and can communicate with the computer through a serial interface (that is hidden in a USB connection).  A very nice and simple programming language makes the Arduino very simple to program.  The Micro-Manager interface to the Arduino consists of an Arduino program (the 'firmware') that you need to upload to the Arduino first.  The current version of the Micro-Manager has facilities to use the Arduino as a shutter, and as a shutter that only opens when a TTL is set high (for instance, when the camera is exposing).  Also, timed sequences of TTL output can be setup.  There are also facilities for programmable analogue out, however, those need connection of a DA chip and requires constructions of a 'daughterboard'/'shield'.

== Installation ==

=== Arduino Software ===
Download and install the [http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software Arduino Software] for your platform.  Establish a connection with your Arduino using the instructions that come with the Arduino software (this includes installing a driver for the USB to serial adapter built into the Arduino.

=== Firmware ===
Then download the [https://valelab.ucsf.edu/svn/micromanager2/trunk/DeviceAdapters/Arduino/AOTFcontroller/AOTFcontroller.ino firmware source code] and copy into the Arduino editor.  Send to the Arduino, and your Arduino is programmed to work with Micro-Manager.

== Hardware Configuration Wizard ==

=== Hub ===
Add the Arduino-Hub.  You may want to set the "Verbose" property of the port to 0 to avoid extensive logging of the communcation with the device, especially if you are using the input functionality (which queries the Arduino every second).

=== Peripheral Devices Setup ===

{| class="wikitable"
!style="width: 20%;"| Name || Description
|- valign="top"
| Arduino-Switch ||  Digital output pattern set across pins 8 to 13.  See usage in [[#Digital IO]]
|- valign="top"
| Arduino-Shutter || Toggles the digital outputs pattern across pins 8 to 13.  Set all pins off when the shutter is closed, and restores the value set in <code>Switch-State</code> when the shutter is opened.
|- valign="top"
| Arduino-Input || Reports, both, the digital and analog (0-1023) state of the analog input pins 0 to 5.
|- valign="top"
| Arduino-DAC{1,2} || (Not usually used) Reserved for TLV5618 AOTF Peripheral.  There does not appear to be any documentation of this peripheral and seems to be a bespoke AOTF control board built for UCSF.

{| class="wikitable"
!style="width: 20%;"| Initialization Properties || Description
|- valign="top"
| Pin || Reads all 6 input pins when set to '''All''', otherwise reads the individual 0-5 Pin number.
|- valign="top"
| Pull-Up-Resistor || Choose whether the Arduino should use its internal 20 kOhm internal pull-up resistor.  If not sure, choose '''On'''.
|}

=== Test Communication ===
Arduino boards Duemilanove and newer feature an LED attached to pin 13.  One can verify the Arduino is communicating by changing the state of pin 13 and verifying the LED changes.  Setting pin 13 HIGH requires setting the <code>Arduino-Switch-State</code> to 32 (i.e. 2^5) in the <code>Device/Property Browser</code>.  If you added the <code>Arduino-Shutter</code> peripheral to the <code>Arduino-Hub</code> toggle the <code>Arduino-Shutter</code> in the main MM window, or if you don't have it change the <code>Arduino-Switch-State</code> back to 0 to see the LED go off.

== Usage Notes ==

=== Digital IO ===
All possible combinations of digital outputs that can be set across pins 8 to 13 can be set by a single number from from 0 to 63, with 0 turning off all pins and 63 turning all pins on.

To choose the set of pins to be on for your <code>Arduino-Switch-State</code> pattern, simply add all the decimal values for the pin from the table below; so for pins 8 and 10 to be on, needs a decimal value of 1 + 4 = '''5''' to be set in <code>Arduino-Switch-State</code>.

{| class="wikitable"
! Pin || Bit || Decimal Value when On
|-
|  8 || 0 ||  1
|-
|  9 || 1 ||  2
|-
| 10 || 2 ||  4
|-
| 11 || 3 ||  8
|-
| 12 || 4 || 16
|-
| 13 || 5 || 32
|}

The reason one has to do this is MM encodes the pins as bits in binary.  Pin 13 corresponds to the most significant bit 5, whose decimal value is 2^5 = 32.  Similarly pin 10 will be bit 2 which has a decimal value of 2^2 = 4.

=== Device Properties ===
{| class="wikitable"
!style="width: 20%;"| Properties || Description

| Switch-Label || Set the digital output pattern across pins 8 to 13.  Allows values 0-63.  See usage in [[#Digital IO]]
|- valign="top"
| Switch-Sequence || '''Off''' operates the Arduino in normal "switching" mode.<br/>'''On''' enables triggered "sequencing" mode.  One defines and upload multiple pattern states to the Arduino [https://valelab.ucsf.edu/svn/micromanager2/trunk/scripts/sequencePropTest.bsh using a Beanshell script].  Then the digital input signal to pin 2 switches between the sets of patterns.  Typically, one would connect the camera exposure signal to pin 2.

|- valign="top"
| Input-DigitalInput || Value depends on how the <code>Pin</code> initialization property was set.  Shows binary state of the input pin, if a single in was selected.  Shows the 5-bit value of all input pins if "All" was selected.
