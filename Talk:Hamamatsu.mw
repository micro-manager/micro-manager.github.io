Hi,

  I was wondering if there was a way to use the micromanager at the MMcore/c++ level without having to buy the Hamamatsu/DCAMSDK (costs $1500).

Hi Haig,

Just do not compile the Micro-Manager DCAM adapter, but instead use the one included in the binary distribution.

Hi Nico,

  We are very interested to use the MMcore layer as part of our own application.  We have specialized automation and focusing needs and we also want our controller to store all relevant information directly in a database.

  If we have a separate application what do we need to include in terms of dll's and header files in order to create and access the MMCore objet.
