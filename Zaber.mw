The Zaber device adapter supports single and dual-axis stages and microscope components using the Zaber ASCII protocol. The devices can be daisy-chained or connected to separate serial ports in an arbitrary configuration.

== Compatibility ==

Currently Micro-Manager has three kinds of drivers for controlling Zaber devices: Stage, XYStage, and Filter Wheel. These drivers require Zaber devices to have firmware 6.06+ and be set to use the Zaber ASCII protocol. Additionally, the XYStage driver requires that at least two devices are connected to a port, and the Filter Wheel driver requires that an [http://www.zaber.com/products/product_group.php?group=X-FWRX-FWR filter wheel] is connected.

==Set Up==

===Zaber Device===
If you're using Zaber stand-alone controllers, first ensure that they are configured by following the easy set-up page here: [http://www.zaber.com/products/product_group.php?group=X-MCB2&tab=Easy%20Set-up X-MCB2 Easy Set-Up]. In particular, ensure the controller has optimized settings by setting the correct ''peripheralid'' setting. You can find more information on how to set the peripheral ID in Zaberâ€™s Protocol Manuals ([https://www.zaber.com/wiki/Manuals/ASCII_Protocol_Manual#peripheralid ASCII]).
 
If you're using Zaber devices with built-in controllers, follow the easy set-up page here: [http://www.zaber.com/products/product_group.php?group=X-FWR-E&tab=Easy%20Set-up Built-In Controller Easy Set-Up].

==Control==

There are several ways to control the position of the stage:
*Stage Control Plugin
*Mouse Movement (click and drag in Snap/Live Window)
*Filter Wheel Presets
*Using the manual adjustment knobs on the controller

Adjust the speed and acceleration of each device through the ''Tools > Device/Property Browser'' dialogue box.
