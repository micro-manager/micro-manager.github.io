This adapter was contributed by Matt Austin from QImaging.  It should work with all monochrome QImaging cameras.  We tested it with a Retiga 4000R on both Windows and Mac and a Retiga EXi on a Mac.  

To use this adapter, you must have version 2.0.4 or higher of the [[http://www.qimaging.com/support/downloads/index.php QCam driver]] installed. Use the example config file (or use the hardware config wizard to make one yourself) to get the camera to work.  Note that QImaging cameras have a default value of 0 for the gray-scale value offset.  This will result in many pixels with a value of zero (indicating clipping of negative values).  It is best to set this value to something like 100.  Also, the camera will start up in 8-bit, if your camera is capable, you will want to set this to 12-bit.  You can do so by making a Configuration Preset Group called 'System' and making a Configuration Preset called 'Startup' in which you set these camera parameters.

Note: As of 11/25/08 the link provided above does not give the right driver version. You need to download the [[http://www.qimaging.com/support/downloads/legacy_qcamdriver.php legacy drivers]].

Note: The 2.0.4 version of the driver does not appear to have a link on the site but can still be got from the website at this [[http://www.qimaging.com/support/downloads/software/windows/QCamDriver2004.exe link]] (Tested on 25th Feb 2009).
