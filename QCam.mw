This adapter was contributed by Matt Austin from QImaging.  It should work with all monochrome QImaging cameras.  We tested it with a Retiga 4000R on both Windows and Mac and a Retiga EXi on a Mac.  

To use this adapter, you must first install the QCam driver for ([http://www.qimaging.com/support/downloads/index.php Windows] or [http://www.qimaging.com/support/downloads/legacy_qcamdriver.php Mac OSX]). As of Micro-Manager version 1.3.47, you should use the QCam driver version 2.0.9 or higher (older Micro-Manager version work with QCam driver 2.0.4 or higher).  Use the example config file (or use the hardware config wizard to make one yourself) to get the camera to work.  Note that QImaging cameras have a default value of 0 for the gray-scale value offset.  This will result in many pixels with a value of zero (indicating clipping of negative values).  It is best to set this value to something like 100.  Also, the camera will start up in 8-bit, if your camera is capable, you will want to set this to 12-bit.  You can do so by making a Configuration Preset Group called 'System' and making a Configuration Preset called 'Startup' in which you set these camera parameters.

The Rolera MGi-Plus is an EM CCD camera that does not use the QImaging driver but interfaces with PVCAM instead.  Use the  [[PVCAM]] adapter for that camera.

Note: As of 11/25/08 the link provided above does not give the right driver version. You need to download the [[http://www.qimaging.com/support/downloads/legacy_qcamdriver.php legacy drivers]].

Note: The 2.0.4 version of the driver does not appear to be linked to from the site but can still be obtained by pointing your browser [[http://www.qimaging.com/support/downloads/software/windows/QCamDriver2004.exe here]] (Tested on 25th Feb 2009).

Note: QCam 2.0.8 and above require the firewire card's driver to be upgraded from the generic microsoft driver to the newer thesycon driver. There will be some cards that are not supported. After installation, the FW card should be recognized as a 'T1394bus OHCI' device.
