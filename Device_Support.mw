__NOTOC__
Most difficulties in working with Micro-Manager arise from configuring the system and from problems/issues with specific devices.  In both of these cases you are interacting mainly with device adapters.  These device adapters have been written by several different authors, all behave slightly differently, and interact with specific hardware that has its own peculiarities.  On these pages we will maintain as much information as possible about Micro-Manager device adapters.  This will help you configure and understand your Micro-Manager system.  We hope that the authors of the device adapters will maintain this information, but please feel free to update the information here with your own experiences.  The information here will refer to the [[Download_Micro-Manager_Latest_Release|most recent Micro-Manager release]].
