This adapter makes Micro-Manager work with DCAM-compatible Hamamatsu cameras.  You will need to download and install a recent version of the [http://www.dcamapi.com/ DCAM driver].

If Micro-Manager reports: "No camera found" while configuring Micro-Manager with a Hamamatsu camera, make sure that it works with the software provided by Hamamatsu.  On Windows, you can launch it by starting the Hamamatsu installer, click the "Others" button, and select "ExCap".  Make sure that Excap finds your camera and that you can "Snap" an image in ExCap.  If ExCap does not find the camera, it is likely that the wrong driver is installed for your Firewire Hamamatsu camera.  Open the Windows Device Manager (Start->Control Panel->System->Hardware->Device Manager). Find the Hamamatsu camera (it can be under "Imaging Devices").  Right click and select "Properties".  Make sure that the driver is from Hamamatsu.  If it is not (most likely alternative is that the driver is from Microsoft), uninstall the driver, and re-install, making sure that the Hamamatsu driver is installed this time.

This adapter does not work with all cameras that are DCAM compatible.  All firewire cameras that we tested (AG, ERG2, and R2) work alright under Windows, some models had problems on some Intel Apple Macs (share your successes!).  Currently (MM version 1.2.31), the EM cameras (C9100-12 and C9100-13) work both on Windows and Mac.  Other cameras with the Phoenix card might also work (I am having troubles with one that does not respond to software triggers but otherwise works).  In general, try before you buy, and please provide feedback here about successes and failures.
