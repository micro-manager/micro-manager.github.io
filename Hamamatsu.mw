This adapter makes Micro-Manager work with DCAM-compatible Hamamatsu cameras.  You will need to download and install a recent version of the [http://sales.hamamatsu.com/index.php?id=13188404 DCAM driver].

This adapter does not work with all cameras that are DCAM compatible.  For instance, the Hamamatsu EM cameras does not (yet) work.  In fact, we have not yet had a chance to test non-firewire Hamamatsu cameras.  The code has been tested extensively with Firewire cameras (AG and ER2 models).  Some hard to trace problems were encountered with certain Intel Mac Pros.  

''For developers:'' To compile this code you will need the DCAM-SDK from Hamamatsu.  We cannot provide this SDK.  Contact your Hamamatsu dealer if you wish to build this code yourself.
