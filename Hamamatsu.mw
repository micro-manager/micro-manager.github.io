This adapter makes Micro-Manager work with DCAM-compatible Hamamatsu cameras.  You will need to download and install a recent version of the [http://sales.hamamatsu.com/index.php?id=13188404 DCAM driver].

This adapter does not work with all cameras that are DCAM compatible.  All firewire cameras that we tested (mainly the AG and ERG2) work alright under Windows, some models had problems on some Intel Apple Macs (share your successes!).  Currently (MM version 1.2.31), the EM cameras (C9100-12 and C9100-13) work.  Cameras with the Phoenix card might also work (I am having troubles with one that does not respond to software triggers but otherwise works).  In general, try before you buy, and please provide feedback here about successes and failures.  

''For developers:'' To compile this code you will need the DCAM-SDK from Hamamatsu.  We cannot provide this SDK.  Contact your Hamamatsu dealer if you wish to build this code yourself.
