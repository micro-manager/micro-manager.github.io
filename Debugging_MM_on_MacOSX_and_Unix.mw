Debugging of the C++ code on Mac and Unix can proceed as follows:

cd to your ImageJ directory that contains a self-starting Micro-Manager plugin:

    cd ~/ImageJ

Start gdb debugging java:

    $ gdb -arch i386 java

Now tell java on gdb to run ImageJ:

   (gdb) r -cp ij.jar ImageJ

Control-C can interrupt execution.

Please refer to the [http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_toc.html gdb documentation] for debugging commands.
