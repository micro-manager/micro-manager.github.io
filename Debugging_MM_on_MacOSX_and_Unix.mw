==Using gdb==

Debugging of the C++ code on Mac and Unix can proceed as follows:

cd to your ImageJ directory that contains a self-starting Micro-Manager plugin:

    cd ~/ImageJ

Start gdb debugging java:

    $ gdb -arch i386 java

Now tell java on gdb to run ImageJ:

   (gdb) r -cp ij.jar ij.ImageJ

Control-C can interrupt execution.

Please refer to the [http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_toc.html gdb documentation] for debugging commands.


==Using LLDB==

Apple replaced gdb with lldb (around Mac OS X 10.9?).  lldb commands are very similar to gdb, however, please have a look at this [http://lldb.llvm.org/tutorial.html tutorial].  Note that lldb will stop on every SIGSEGV signal generated by java (for an explanation, see [http://fusionsecurity.blogspot.com/2011/10/why-am-i-seeing-sigsegv-when-i-strace.html].  Press 'c' to continue (there may be a more efficient way of dealing with this).

==Using NetBeans with gdb for C++ debugging==

<ol>
<li>Install NetBeans for C++ or install the C/C++ plugin for in your existing NetBeans installation.</li>
<li>Choose File > New Project... . Select Categories=C/C++, Projects=C/C++ Project with Existing Sources.</li>
<li>Specifiy the folder that contains existing sources (e.g., '''/projects/micromanager/''') and press "Finish."</li>
<li>Right-click the new project and select "Properties".</li>
<li>Under Build...Make, set Build Command to "make all; make install" and "Clean Command" to "make clean". Set Build Result to "<your_ImageJ_directory>/ImageJ.app/Contents/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub" .</li>
<li>Add the following option to the '''netbeans_default_options="..."''' line of '''/Applications/NetBeans/NetBeans\ 6.8.app/Contents/Resources/NetBeans/etc/netbeans.conf''' :<pre>-J-Dgdb.init.enable=true</pre></li>
<li> Create a '''.gdbinit''' file in '''~''' that informs gdb of the directories of all '''.cpp''' and '''.h''' source files you might wish to debug:<pre>directory /projects/micromanager/
directory /projects/micromanager/MMCore
directory /projects/micromanager/MMDevice
directory /projects/micromanager/DeviceAdapters/DemoCamera
</pre></li>
<li>Restart Netbeans.</li>
<li>Launch ImageJ (the target of make install from your micromanager source).</li>
<li>Select Debug...Attach debugger.</li>
</ol>
