The Rapp UGA-40 uses galvos to bounce lasers through the microscope objective and target particular spots on the specimen in the image plane. The galvos can also be rastered to illuminate a region of interest. Micro-Manager [[Projector Plugin]] allows users to draw one or more spots or regions of interest on an image of the specimen, and phototarget these areas using the UGA-40. (The Projector Plugin permits both ad hoc phototargeting and planning targeting events embedded in a multi-dimensional acquisition).

The UGA-40 supports up to two lasers of different colors. Choose which laser to use by setting the "Laser" property to "1" or "2".

A few UGA-40-specific properties allow fine-grained control, supplementing the generic controls presented by the Projector Plugin. These include:

{| class="wikitable"
! Property
! Description
|-
! CalibrationMode
| If "On", laser is turned on regardless of targeting status
|-
! TTLTriggered
| For TTL triggering, determines whether triggering occurs on a rising or falling edge
|-
! SpotSize
| Tells the UGA-40 controller how large the measured spot size is, for help with rastering extended ROIs
|-
! RasterFrequency_Hz
| Controls the speed of ROI rastering
|-
! AccuracyPercent
| Controls how precisely an irregular ROI is filled in during rastering
|-
! OnMinimumRectSize
| Determines the smallest tile used during rastering
|-
! Sequence
| Allows a "sequence script" to be uploaded to the UGA-40 controller (rarely used)
