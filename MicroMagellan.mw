The MicroMagellan plugin allows flexible, dynamic device control and acquisition. The Explore feature allows you to examine your sample in XY and Z, building a 3D map of all areas covered, minimizing photo-bleaching and damage while finding areas of interest. Surfaces allows you to define an non-cuboidal region of interest and define sample morphology, which can then be used to define sample-driven parameters such as laser power at distance from surface. Using grids or surfaces, you can designate multiple areas to image in a single acquisition in series or in parallel.
