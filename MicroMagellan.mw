The Micro-Magellan plugin allows flexible, dynamic device control and acquisition. The Explore feature allows you to examine your sample in XY and Z, building a 3D map of all areas covered, minimizing photo-bleaching and damage while finding areas of interest. Surfaces allows you to define an non-cuboidal region of interest and define sample morphology, which can then be used to define sample-driven parameters such as laser power at distance from surface. Using grids or surfaces, you can designate multiple areas to image in a single acquisition in series or in parallel.  

==Getting Started with Micro-Magellan :==
In order for Micro-Magellan to operate, it needs to know the direction of Z movement. This is defined in the Hardware Configuration Wizard.

In order for Micro-Magellan to acquire tiled images and assemble them, it must have an accurate pixel size calibration for the objective in use. If you have already calibrated your pixel size using the “Pixel size calibrator” plug-in from MicroManager, this should automatically propagate to Micro-Magellan. Before using Explore mode, verify that the calibration is correct by pressing “Calibrate”. 
If the fields are populated as below, Micro-Magellan has the necessary information. These parameters can be adjusted manually to fine tune stage movement for improved stitching. 
If the calibration window shows a size of 0.0um, you can run click Start and follow the wizard instructions to generate an affine transform.

==Setting Up Micro-Magellan for Device Control :==

From the plug-ins menu, select Micro-Magellan, and the unpopulated window opens. Select "Configure Device Control"

A new window will open with a list of available devices and properties. You may also enter a "nickname" that more easily identifies the device/property. Selected devices/properties will appear in the Device status/control tab after pressing "Ok"

==Using Explore Mode :==
Before exploring your sample you will need to enter your desired Z-step size and tile overlap. The channel group drop down is analogous to the channel group drop down within MicroManager’s Multi-Dimensional Acquisition and will be pre-populated with the configurations groups you have created. Select the settings group that contains your channel configurations.

Pressing “Explore!” will open a new window:

On the left side is your image area; a field of view will highlight blue as you hover over it. On the right, are look-up tables (LUTs) for each channel and several other acquisition setup parameters.  
To acquire an image in that area click to select (area will highlight green during active selection), once your selection is highlighted magenta, click again to confirm. You can click and drag to select multiple fields of view to be imaged. 
The "Z limits" scroll bars below the image window control which Z locations will be imaged, and will adjust automatically to the selected Z-step size.

==Using Micro-Magellan with BigDataViewer :==
Micro-Magellan writes data in a multiresolution file format that is compatible with FIJI's BigDataViewer (http://fiji.sc/BigDataViewer), a reslicing browser for terabyte-sized image volumes that is integrated with a number of image processing tools. In order for BigDataViewer to recognize the Micro-Magellan file format, the "Magellan.jar" file must be copied into a FIJI installation. To do this:

1) Open FIJI and select Help--Update <br>
2) Click the "Manage Update Sites" button <br>
3) Check the box next to Micro-Magellan <br>
4) Click "Close" <br>
5) Click "Apply changes" <br>
