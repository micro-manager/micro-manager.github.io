The Micro-Magellan plugin allows flexible, dynamic device control and acquisition. The Explore feature allows you to examine your sample in XY and Z, building a 3D map of all areas covered, minimizing photo-bleaching and damage while finding areas of interest. Surfaces allows you to define an non-cuboidal region of interest and define sample morphology, which can then be used to define sample-driven parameters such as laser power at distance from surface. Using grids or surfaces, you can designate multiple areas to image in a single acquisition in series or in parallel.  

==Using Micro-Magellan with BigDataViewer :==
Micro-Magellan writes data in a multiresolution file format that is compatible with FIJI's BigDataViewer (http://fiji.sc/BigDataViewer), a reslicing browser for terabyte-sized image volumes that is integrated with a number of image processing tools. In order for BigDataViewer to recognize the Micro-Magellan file format, the "Magellan.jar" file must be copied into a FIJI installation. To do this:

1) Open FIJI and select Help--Update <br>
2) Click the "Manage Update Sites" button
3) Check the box next to Micro-Magellan
4) Click "Close"
5) Click "Apply changes"
