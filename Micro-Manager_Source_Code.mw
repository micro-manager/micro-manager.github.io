__NOTOC__
The source code includes all Micro-Manager files (Java and C++) and all supporting files (project files, build scripts, etc.). However, to build the entire project a number of Open Source libraries and device SDKs must be installed. Instructions for building Micro-Manager are available for [[Full_Build_on_MacOS_X_Leopard |Mac]], [[Building_MM_on_Windows|Windows]], and [[Linux_installation_from_source_(Ubuntu)|Linux]].

== Note about the source code licensing terms ==

Micro-Manager is structured in three distinct layers: Graphical User Interface (GUI), Device Adapters and MMCore. All source files, except ones carrying a different license notice in the header, are copyright of University of California. GUI and Device adapters are distributed under the "[http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php BSD]" license, while MMCore is distributed under "[http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php Lesser GPL]" license. License text files are included in the source package, and each file should have a header stating the exact type of license. A good starting point to learn more about the Open Source Code licensing is http://www.opensource.org/. If you have any questions or need some clarification regarding our licensing terms please let us know: [mailto:info@micro-manager.org info@micro-manager.org]

== Subversion repository for current development version ==

To access the subversion repository you will need a [http://subversion.tigris.org/ subversion client].

https://valelab.ucsf.edu/svn/micromanager2/trunk/ - Release 1.4<br />
https://valelab.ucsf.edu/svn/3rdpartypublic/ - 3rd party files needed for Release 1.4<br />

{{Note|There is a bug in the Subversion 1.8 client that prevents you from checking out our public repositories without a username. If Subversion asks you for a username and password, you can use the username "guest" (password "guest") as a workaround. Subversion 1.7.x clients should not experience this problem.}}

To build Micro-Manager 1.4, you should place the micromanager2 (trunk) and 3rdpartypublic repositories in the same directory. For example, run the following from your projects directory:

<code><pre>svn checkout https://valelab.ucsf.edu/svn/micromanager2/trunk micromanager
svn checkout https://valelab.ucsf.edu/svn/3rdpartypublic</pre></code>

* [[Building and debugging Micro-Manager source code]]
