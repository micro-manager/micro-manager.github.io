__NOTOC__
The source code includes all Micro-Manager files (Java and C++) and all supporting files (project files, build scripts, etc.). However, to build the entire project a number of Open Source libraries and device SDKs must be installed. Instructions for building Micro-Manager are available for [[Full_Build_on_MacOS_X_Leopard |Mac]], [[Building_MM_on_Windows|Windows]], and [[Linux_installation_from_source_(Ubuntu)|Linux]].

== Note about the source code licensing terms ==

Micro-Manager is structured in three distinct layers: Graphical User Interface (GUI), Device Adapters and MMCore. All source files, except ones carrying a different license notice in the header, are copyright of University of California. GUI and Device adapters are distributed under the "[http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php BSD]" license, while MMCore is distributed under "[http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php Lesser GPL]" license. License text files are included in the source package, and each file should have a header stating the exact type of license. A good starting point to learn more about the Open Source Code licensing is http://www.opensource.org/. If you have any questions or need some clarification regarding our licensing terms please let us know: [mailto:info@micro-manager.org info@micro-manager.org]


== Github repository for 2.0 ==

The source code for 2.0-gamma is located on github at:

https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager in the master branch.

== Subversion repository for 1.4 ==

To access the subversion repository you will need a [http://subversion.tigris.org/ subversion client].

https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/svn/micromanager2/trunk/ - Release 1.4<br />
https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/svn/3rdpartypublic/ - 3rd party files needed for Release 1.4<br />

{{Note|There is a bug in the Subversion 1.8 client that prevents you from checking out our public repositories without a username. If Subversion asks you for a username and password, you can use the username "guest" (password "guest") as a workaround. Subversion 1.7.x clients should not experience this problem.}}

{{Note|Sometimes, a fresh checkout of the 3rdpartypublic repository will fail (possibly due to the subversion server timeout settings) with <code>ra_surf: The server sent a truncated HTTP response body</code>.  To work around this, run <code>svn cleanup</code> and then <code>svn up</code> per [http://stackoverflow.com/a/33996416] (on Windows, Tortoise SVN users can right click inside the 3rdpartypublic directory > TortoiseSVN > Cleaup ... > Break locks (make sure it's checked) > OK).  Then continue with right-click, "SVN update".  This timeout will happen twice during boost checkout because of the large file sizes.}}

To build Micro-Manager 1.4, you should place the micromanager2 (trunk) and 3rdpartypublic repositories in the same directory. For example, run the following from your projects directory:

<code><pre>svn checkout https://valelab.ucsf.edu/svn/micromanager2/trunk micromanager
svn checkout https://valelab.ucsf.edu/svn/3rdpartypublic</pre></code>
