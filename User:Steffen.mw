Hi, I'm currently a computer course, my topic is to create an adapter controls stages conected to PI GCS controllers and conect via a PCI port. I wanted to know if you could send me your code about this, as well as some explanations to understand how you did. This will allow me to adjust my program to a PCI port. Thank you in advance. Sincerely.
