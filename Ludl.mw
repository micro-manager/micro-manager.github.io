This adapter controls equipment through the [http://www.ludl.com/ Ludl] MAC family of controllers.  It has mainly been tested with the [http://www.ludl.com/pageDisplay.aspx?menumode=BIO&PageReq=MAC5000 MAC5000] controller but might  work with previous versions as well. 

All communications to devices take place through the Controller device (i.e., the MAC5000). Set the Serial port to use 9600 baud and 2 stopbits.  The adapter uses the 'high level' command interface (is there anyone who feels like implementing the low level interface?) Currently, you can only use one controller.  You can set the serial port for communcation with the controller, and you can define the 'transmissiondelay' (0.5 msec between chars send by the controller to the computer).  It is probably safe to set this value to 1 (the lowest) with modern computers.  

There can be up to 5 'devices' (i.e., controller cards) per controller, and each controller card can have 3 shutters and 2 filter wheels.  You will therefore need to specify for each Wheel and Shutter a device number (1-5 and WheelNumber (1-2) or ShutterNumber (1-3).

The XYStage will let you set some parameters concerning the speed of the stage (Speed, StartSpeed, Acceleration).  See the [http://www.ludl.com/DocLib.aspx manual] for definition of these terms.
