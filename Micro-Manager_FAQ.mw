'''Micro-Manager, Frequently Asked Questions'''
=== Does Micro-Manager work with ... camera/microscope/etc? ===
Check the list of [[Device Support|supported hardware]].  If you are unsure, post your question to the [https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/micro-manager-general Mailing List]

=== There is an ImageJ driver for my camera.  Can I use the camera with Micro-Manager? ===
Not necessarily.  Micro-Manager provides an identical interface to all cameras, which means that scripts and applications written using Micro-Manager will work with all supported cameras.  ImageJ camera drivers do not work that way (i.e., they are all different, and Micro-Manager has no way of operating with them), so whether or not there is an ImageJ driver for a device has no bearing on it working with Micro-Manager.  In technical terms, to make a camera work in Micro-Manager, you will need a Micro-Manager device adapter (written in C++), which is very different from an ImageJ camera driver.  Check the list of [[Device Support|supported hardware]] to see if there is a Micro-Manager device adapter for your camera.

=== I have some hardware that is not supported by Micro-Manager.  How do I make it work? ===
First, contact the manufacturer of the hardware and express your interest in a Micro-Manager adapter.  We simply do not have the resources to work on every piece of hardware out there and we made an open interface so that everyone can write support for any piece of hardware.  We strongly encourage companies producing hardware to take care of Micro-Manager support themselves (and quite a few have already done so).  The company might be persuaded if they hear from enough customers.  Alternatively, you can write the adapter yourself, or find a friend with experience writing code in C++  (there are quite a few examples so it will not be extremely difficult).  There is a [http://micro-manager.org/downloads.php?object=devkit device developer's kit], and providing support to people writing device adapters is one of our top priorities.  Lastly, post your request to the  [https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/micro-manager-general Micro-Manager mailing list].  We or others might be persuaded to work on this if we hear that people need it.

=== Does Micro-Manager work with my Axiocam camera? ===
No.  Despite many requests from us and Micro-Manager users, Zeiss does not make available the documentation and programming interface needed to operate AxioCam cameras.  If you have one of these cameras and would like to operate it with Micro-Manager, please ask your local Zeiss contact person to make available the AxioCam SDK to the Micro-Manager team.  If you are considering to buy one of these cameras, be aware that it will lock you into using Zeiss software with that camera.  If you have one of these cameras and want to upgrade your system, it might be cheaper to buy a decent Micro-Manager compatible camera (for instance from "The Imaging Source" or "Scion") than to buy a new copy of AxioVision.

=== Something does not work.  What do I do? ===
Download and install the latest [http://micro-manager.org/downloads.php?object=nightly nightly build] and check if the problem still persists. Send an email describing your problem to the [https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/micro-manager-general Micro-Manager mailing list].  Describe your system (OS, attached hardware), and describe the steps that lead to the problem you encounter as well as the error message you see. Include the configuration file that you are using (the *.cfg file you select on startup) .  Please do not send screenshots!

If the problem is not resolvable through the email list, you will need to send more debug information. To do so, go to the 'Tools' menu in Micro-Manager and select 'Options...'. Click the 'Clear log file' button and make sure that the 'Debug log enabled' checkbox is checked.  Now repeat the steps that cause the error and then email the entire 'CoreLog.txt' file (in your Micro-Manager directory) to [mailto::info@micro-manager.org info@micro-Manager.org] together with your config file and a description of the problem (include the error message on the screen). We will likely need your help to test some code modifications to deal with your problem.

In some cases, even more debug output can be obtained by running Micro-Manager from a command terminal.  On the Mac:<br>
1. open a terminal (Applications/Utilities/Terminal)<br>
2. Type: cd /Applications/Micro-Manager1.3<br>
3. Start Micro-Manager by typing: java -cp ij.jar ij.ImageJ<br>
4. Copy relevant output from the terminal into your email.<br>

On Windows:<br>
1. open a terminal (Start->Run..., type 'cmd', click 'OK')<br>
2. Type: cd "C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager1.3"<br>
3. Start Micro-Manager by typing: jre\bin\java -cp ij.jar ij.ImageJ<br>
4. Copy relevant output from the terminal into your email.<br>
