Research interests

My research work is dedicated to build bridges between micro / nanotechnology and health sciences, taking advantage of microfluidic devices and analytical methods. Here at Biomat’X, I am contributing to develop whole microbiotes detection and quantification taking advantage of microfluidics, aptamer and SPRi. Bacteria in food and water has become a growing society concern as WHO recent report has driven regulation tighter. New methods with faster and lower limit of detection are required. Taking advantage of SPR label-free straightforward detection and microfluidics enhanced analytical performances, we are pushing the limits of detection as well as increasing specificity and analysis throughput.

During my thesis work, I focused on microrobotic mobile transducer for microbiology applications as well as microrobots dynamics analysis. The microfluidics provided a development environment as well as a ground for new applications. I then investigated nanovectors developments for hepatic imaging applications. Microfluidics becoming a key enable in nanomedicines clinical translation, I developed characterization using hyphenated methods combining fluidic separative methods and physical detection. I developed separative methods taking advantages of field flow flow fractionation for aggregation and conjugates quantification as well as size distribution analysis.

I am deeply convinced in the virtue of collaboration between academic world and industry in applied sciences. I have been collaborating with several SME partners (Eden Microfluidics, Black Hole Laboratory, Wyatt Technology France) with whom I have intended to maintain a virtuous circle of development for microfabrication, material and analytical method development. 

I welcome any question concerning my former work but also research fields and interests - closely related or not.
