These abstract devices can be used to change the function of a real device or to combine multiple real devices into a single, logical device.  

'''Multi-Shutter'''
Combines multiple shutters into a single logical shutter, opens and closes multiple shutter simultaneously.  You will need to set the "Physical Shutter: properties (up to 5 shutters can be set).  It is easiest to set these in the "System" "Startup" group so that they will be set automatically upon loading the configuration file.
