Micro-Manager is free and open source -- it is funded by a grant from the NIH (US National Institutes of Health). The Vale lab's development and maintenance of Micro-Manager will depend on more grants in the future, and these grants will only be awarded if researchers cite their use of Micro-Manager in their scientific publications.

When you publish results using Micro-Manager, please cite one of the following papers:
