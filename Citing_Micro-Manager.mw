Micro-Manager is free and open source -- it is funded by a grant from the NIH (US National Institutes of Health). The Vale lab's development and maintenance of Micro-Manager will depend on more grants in the future, and these grants will only be awarded if researchers cite their use of Micro-Manager in their scientific publications.

Whenever you publish results that used Micro-Manager, please cite the following paper:
