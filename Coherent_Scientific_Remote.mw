This device adapter was written for the Coherent Obis Scientific Remote Laser Controller. Compatibility was also tested with the Coherent Obis Single Remote. 
<br>
Inside MicroManager, for each connected laser, the following command 'properties' are available with this device adapter:
<ul>
    <li>Laser Power (%) ''(Read/Write)''
    <li>Laser State (On/Off) ''(Read/Write)''
    <li>Modulation/Trigger (CW, Digital, Analog) ''(Read/Write)''
    <li>Head Usage (h) ''(Read only)''
    <li>Wavelength (nm) ''(Read only)''
    <li>Minimum Laser Power (mW) ''(Read only)''
    <li>Maximum Laser Power (mW) ''(Read only)''
    <li>Power Readback (mW) ''(Read only)''
    <li>Laser Port ''(Read Only)''
    <li>Temperature Baseplate (Â°C) ''(Read only)''
</ul>
In addition any laser can be selected for being shuttered software-wise while acquiring an image.
