I graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology with a Bachelors degree in computer engineering in 2000.  I am a software engineer for Hamamatsu Corporation.  I am a developer for the Hamamatsu device adapter for Micro-Manager.  One of my goals is to have the device adapter fully compatible with all of our Hamamatsu cameras.  On the side, I enjoy capoeira, parkour, photography, and cinematography.
