__NOTOC__
Micro-Manager provides for the precise and rapid triggering of sequences of channels and focus positions by the camera.

===Channels===
LED illuminators and AOTF-based laser combiners both have very fast switching times, and are thus prime candidates for hardware synchronization. 

===Focal drives===
Piezo z stages move rapidly enough such that a sequence of z positions can be synchronized with a camera running at tens of frames per second.

===Multi-Dimensional Acquisition===
Micro-Manager's multi-dimensional acquisition (MDA) engine practices opportunistic triggering: that is, if a triggered sequence is possible, then triggering will be carried out. Thus the user interface for triggered MDA is exactly the same as that for non-triggered MDA.

===Controller Devices that currently support Triggered Sequences===
* [[AgilentLaserCombiner]] -- Laser channel switching
* [[Arduino]] -- TTL and DAC output states
* [[ASIStage]] -- ASI piezo focus drives
* [[ESIOImagingControllers]] -- AOTFs (laser combiners) and piezo focus drives
* [[Marzhauser]] (TANGO controller) --  Märzhäuser piezo focus drive
