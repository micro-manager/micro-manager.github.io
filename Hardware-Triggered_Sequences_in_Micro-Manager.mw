Micro-Manager features a triggering framework that permits the precise and rapid synchronization of some hardware components with a camera.

===Supported Devices===
* [[Arduino]] -- Allows triggering of TTL and DAC outputs
* [[ASIStage]] -- Allows triggering of ASI piezo focus drives
* [[AgilentLaserCombiner]] -- Accepts TTL pulses for laser channel switching
* [[ESIOImagingControllers]] -- controls AOTFs (laser combiners) and piezo focus drives

===Channels===
LED illuminators and AOTF-based laser combiners both have very fast switching times, and are thus prime candidates for hardware synchronization. 

===Multi-Dimensional Acquisition===
