Micro-Manager permits the precise and rapid triggering of sequences of properties and stage positions by the camera.

===Controller Devices that support Triggered Sequences===
* [[Arduino]] -- TTL and DAC output states
* [[ASIStage]] -- ASI piezo focus drives
* [[AgilentLaserCombiner]] -- Laser channel switching
* [[ESIOImagingControllers]] -- AOTFs (laser combiners) and piezo focus drives
* [[Marzhauser]] -- Focus drive

===Channels===
LED illuminators and AOTF-based laser combiners both have very fast switching times, and are thus prime candidates for hardware synchronization.
