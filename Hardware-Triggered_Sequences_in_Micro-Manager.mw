Micro-Manager features a triggering framework that permits the precise and rapid synchronization of some hardware components with a camera.

===Supported Controller Devices===
* [[Arduino]] -- Allows triggered sequencing of TTL and DAC states
* [[ASIStage]] -- Allows triggered sequencing of ASI piezo focus drives
* [[AgilentLaserCombiner]] -- Accepts TTL pulses for laser channel switching, as well as DAC control of piezo cofus drives
* [[ESIOImagingControllers]] -- controls AOTFs (laser combiners) and piezo focus drives
* [[Marzhauser]] -- triggering of focus drive

===Channels===
LED illuminators and AOTF-based laser combiners both have very fast switching times, and are thus prime candidates for hardware synchronization. 

===Multi-Dimensional Acquisition===
