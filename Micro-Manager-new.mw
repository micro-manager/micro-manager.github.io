μManager has a simple and clean user interface, and lets you execute common microscope image acquisition strategies such as time-lapses, multi-channel imaging, z-stacks, and combinations thereof. μManager works with microscopes from all four major manufacturers (Leica, Nikon, Olympus and Zeiss), most scientific-grade cameras and many peripherals (stages, filter wheels, shutters, etc.) used in microscope imaging (check the [[Device_Support|list of supported hardware]]).

=== [[Micro-Manager Programming Guide | EXTENDING μMANAGER]] ===

Even if you are not interested in writing software code for your microscope, the open software architecture of μManager will benefit you. For instance, the Open Device Interface lets anyone write code to control microscope-related equipment, resulting a large and growing list of supported equipment. A scripting interface makes it possible to accomplish tasks that can not be execute within the GUI. Lastly, the μManager programming interface can be used from many different environments (including Matlab) to develop new applications, all using the same μManager Microscope device control.
