==Installation==

=== Driver ===

* Copy the following 4 library files to the main Micro-Manager directory:

    atcore.dll
    atdevmosaic3.dll
    Mosaic3ApiSharedMfc.dll
    Mosaic3SDKWrapper.dll

:These Mosaic library files need to be copied from another installed software, as listed below:

{| class="wikitable"
! Software            !! Directory containing required files
|-
| Andor iQ            || <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Andor Bioimaging\Common Files\</code>
|-
| Andor Mosaic 3 SDK  || <code>C:\Program Files\Andor Mosaic 3 SDK\sdk\</code>
|}

:If you don't have either of these installed, they are available at http://my.andor.com

* Check that the driver for the PCIe card is recognized in the Device Manager as <code> PLDA > PLDA Windows Driver</code>.

=== Hardware Configuration Wizard ===

==== Mosaic ====

To allow Micro-Manager to control the Mosaic, add the Mosaic3 device using Micro-Manager's [[Micro-Manager_Configuration_Guide#Hardware_Configuration_Wizard|Hardware Configuration Wizard]]. When you add the device, there are no configuration options.

==== Shutter control of the Projected Light Source ====

The Mosaic allows a low level of light through even when the digital mirrors are off, and therefore the Mosaic can be optionally purchased with the a physical shutter accessory.  This shutter accessory is connected to a Vincent VCM-D1 controller, so to control it in Micro-Manager add the [[Vincent|Vincent device]].

Shutter control is primarily intended for light sources which cannot be directly modulated, like a Mercury lamp; for light sources that can be modulated, best practice is instead to simply connect the "DMD Active" TTL 5 volt output to your light source "global shutter" (or similar) TTL input so that it is only on when the Mosaic is active.  You may not have the shutter accessory installed on if your system was ordered with the intention of using it with this type of TTL light source.

If you have the [http://www.powertechnology.com/products/laser-diode-modules/lasers-w-modulation/iq1a.html Power Technology diode laser], you may wish to still add the Vincent device because this laser always leaks ~4mW from the laser head even in the off position (0 volt Analog input).  This laser leak is difficult to observe normally since the laser safety interlocks would shut off the laser.

=== Calibration ===

Controlling the Mosaic, like other SLM and Galvo devices, is done by the Projector plugin ('''Plugins | Device Control | Projector''').

{{Note|Many functions of the generically designed Projector plugin are not useful for the Mosaic.  For normal use, one would just open the Projector plugin to go to the ROIs tab and open the Sequencing window.}}

Before you begin the calibration:
* Make sure a camera has been installed using the Hardware Configuration Wizard.
* In the [[Projector_Plugin#Setup_tab|Setup tab]] of the Projector plugin:
** If your microscope system requires changing a property for the Mosaic projected light to reach your specimen (often if your imaging reflector cube is different from the mosaic reflector cube), create a Group and a Presets each for your Mosaic reflector and your epi imaging reflector.  Assign the Core-ChannelGroup to that Group, and finally in the <code>Phototargeting channel</code> choose the Mosaic reflector preset.
** If you added the Vincent shutter device in the Hardware Configuration Wizard, assign it to the <code>Phototargeting shutter</code>.

You may wish to refer to the [[Projector Plugin]] description page if you have not used it before.  However, note that for the Mosaic:
* [[Projector_Plugin#Point_and_Shoot_tab|Point and Shoot tab]]: only projects a fixed-sized round ROI on the live image window and offers no flexibility of shape type and size.
* [[Projector_Plugin#ROIs_tab|ROIs tab]]: is mainly used to open the Sequencing window.  The Sequencing window has a super-set of the functionality of the other controls in the ROIs tab.

Place a test slide (such as a solid fluorescent slide) on the microscope stage. 
Click the {{Key|Calibrate}} button. The Projector Plugin will move through a rectangular lattice of spots across the Mosaic array, illuminating them one by one. The corresponding position on the camera image will be automatically measured. During the calibration procedure, a small cross will be visible overlaid on each spot as it is located. When calibration is finished, the plugin will have acquired and stored a coordinate mapping from camera pixels to Mosaic pixels.

== Sequencing window ==

The Andor Mosaic offers advanced sequencing capabilities. To open the Sequencing Window, in the ROIs tab of the Projector Plugin, click the {{Key|Sequencing...}} button. The button also opens the ImageJ ROI Manager.

=== ROI list ===

Use the ROI Manager window to add, remove and update ROIs.  If you are not as familiar with ImageJ ROIs or have been using the Mosaic in other software packages, read the Projector plugin's discussion about [[Projector_Plugin#Drawing_Multiple_ImageJ_ROIs|drawing multiple ImageJ ROIs]].

The intention of the ROI list is to add more properties to each ROI.  The list synchronizes itself to contain the same set of ROIs as the ROI Manager.
{| class="wikitable"
!style="width: 20%;"| Column
! Description
|- valign="top"
| Roi # || Reference index number automatically generated. This gets referenced later on in the [[#Sequence table]].
|- valign="top"
| Name || Copy of ROI name used in ROI Manager.
|- valign="top"
| Mode || The default '''FRAP''' ROIs appears for short periods of time, whereas '''Image''' ROIs are intended to be illuminated throughout the whole sequence.
|- valign="top"
| Intensity || Sets the projected light intensity level if you have <code>PixelMode</code> set to one of the gray scale settings.
|}

=== Create ROI Grid ===

To aid a specific use case, this feature duplicates a ROI generating a rectangular grid (lattice) of ROIs. Draw the ROI you wish to duplicate in the upper-left corner of your intended grid, enter the number of ROIs across and down and spacing between lattice points.

=== Sequence table ===

{{Note|It's often better to use [[#Create Sequence]] to populate the sequence table instead of hand-filling an empty Sequence table.  The Sequence table is being described first to introduce the nomenclature (particularly the "Time Slot") of the Create Sequence generator.}}

{| class="wikitable"
!style="width: 20%;"| Column
! Description
|- valign="top"
| Time Slot || Reference index number generated by clicking the {{Key|Generate Sequence}} button in the Create Sequence panel, or by the {{Key|Add}} button under under the Sequence table.
|- valign="top"
| ROIs || "Roi #" value in [[#ROI list]].  This can also take a range of Roi #s, e.g. 2-4.
|- valign="top"
| On Duration (ms) || Illumination time.
|- valign="top"
| Off Duration (ms) || Off time after <code>Time Slot</code>
|- valign="top"
| Loops || Number of times the ROIs should be repeatedly illuminated within the <code>Time Slot</code>.  To repeat the entire Sequence table, set the "Sequence Repeats" number below the Sequence table.
|}

and the table alter which ROIs appear in a step, the On and Off times, and the Loop Count. You can add, duplicate, delete, and re-order the steps.

=== Create Sequence ===

ROI sequences consist of a time slots or steps. Within each time slot 1 or more ROIs can be illuminated. 

{| class="wikitable"
!style="width: 20%;"| Item
! Description
|- valign="top"
| Sequence type || '''Sequential''' illiminates each <code>FRAP</code> mode ROI in turn.<br/><br/>'''Cumulative''' illuminates the <code>FRAP</code> mode ROI as it progresses through the <code>Time Slots</code>, until all ROIs are illuminated.<br/><br/>'''Simultaneous''' mode simply shows all ROIs in a single step.
|-
|colspan="2"| The remaining items are described in the Sequence table above (On Duration, Off Duration, Loops).
|}

Click the {{Key|Generate Sequence}} button to populate the Sequence table, below. Notice that all Image-type ROIs are included in every step.

=== Control buttons ===

Below the Sequence table, you can specify how many times the sequence should be repeated, and how the sequence should be triggered. Press the "Upload Sequence" button to send the sequence and ROIs to the Mosaic device. Then press Run to start the sequence. You can also attach your sequence to Micro-Manager's multi-dimensional acquisition, and you can save the sequence for re-loading later.

== Device Properties ==

{| class="wikitable"
!style="width: 20%;"| Property
! Description
|- valign="top"
| Exposure || Pulse duration of mask in seconds.  You would not often change this setting directly since the Sequencing window requires you to set the exposure time in the Sequence list, and the exposure value(s) there takes precedence.  Changing this is useful for interactive use e.g. in the <code>Projector > Setup</code> tab.
|- valign="top"
| OverlapMode || Pulses mask when set to '''Off'''. Can allow static exposure when set to '''On'''.<br/><br/>The '''Off''' setting has the benefit of hardware timing accuracy, but it limits the maximum exposure to 200 seconds.<br/><br/>'''On''', by definition, ignores the value of "Off Duration (ms)" in the Sequence window.  When combined with setting the <code>Exposure</code> to 0, it exposes the mask constantly; if you have use of this ability one can create, say, an "Exposure Mode" group with a preset named something like "Static".
|- valign="top"
| OperationMode || Choose whether to use hardware or software memory.  The default, '''Live''', uses the software memory.<br/><br/>'''FrameSequence''' is used with the Sequence window (opening the sequence window automatically changes to this value for you). If you need the <code>SequenceLoopCount</code> to be infinite use '''ContinuousFrameSequence'''.<br/><br/>If using <code>FrameIndexSource</code> as '''Hardware''', set to '''FrameMemory'''.
|- valign="top"
| FrameIndexSource || Setting this to '''Hardware''' allows switching between uploaded Frames using the TTL 26-pin D-sub breakout cable, by setting the "Frame Address [7:0]" BNC inputs.  Requires <code>OperationMode</code> being set to '''FrameMemory'''.
|- valign="top"
| PixelMode || Switch between '''BlackAndWhite''' and several gray scale settings.
|- valign="top"
| GrayScaleExposureTime || Pulse duration of mask in seconds when setting <code>PixelMode</code> to a value other than '''BlackAndWhite'''.
|- valign="top"
| InvertMode || Inverts all uploaded masks before projecting.  Invert means setting those DMD pixels outside of the 2D ROI On, and those within the 2D ROI Off.
|- valign="top"
| SequenceLoopCount || Number of times to repeat the entire uploaded Frame sequence.  You don't need to adjust this since the Sequence window has a textbox for "Sequence Repeats" which takes precedence.
|- valign="top"
| SequenceLoopSettings || Shows result of clicking "Upload Sequence" from Sequence window; useful for debugging.  Each "Time Slot" entry from the Sequence window list should appear as<br/><code>[Time Slot] [On Duration] [Off Duration] [Number of Loops];</code>
|- valign="top"
| TriggerMode || Switch between various internal and external TTL trigger settings which are detailed in the Mosaic manual.
|}

== Scripting ==

Under the ImageJ menu, select <code>File > New > Image...</code> and create a black, 8-bit 800x600 image. Double click the dropper tool on the ImageJ toolbar and make sure the current drawing color is white. Then double click the paintbrush tool and set the thickness to 20 pixels. Finally, sketch an image with the paint brush.

Open the “Script Panel” (under Micro-Manager’s Tools menu). Enter the following code:

   import ij.IJ; // Allows access to basic ImageJ utilities.
   proc = IJ.getImage().getProcessor().duplicate(); // Read the current image.
   pixels = proc.getPixels(); // Extract pixels from ImageJ ImageProcessor object.
   mosaic = mmc.getSLMDevice(); // Get the installed name of the Mosaic device.
   mmc.setSLMImage(mosaic, pixels); // Upload the image to the Mosaic.
   mmc.displaySLMImage(mosaic); // Display the Mosaic.

Running this script will result in projecting the image you have just drawn onto the Mosaic.

If you save this TIF image, to reuse it in another session of Micro-Manager, you should open it using ImageJ's <code>File > Open</code> and again in the ImageJ menu change <code>Image > Type > 8-bit</code> instead of the default <code>32-bit</code>.
