'''For the fifth year we presented the Micro-Manager software in the Exhibit Hall at the annual meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) in Denver. Our goal was to introduce the Micro-Manager software to new users, gain feedback from current Micro-Manager users, and to demonstrate new capabilities.'''

To demonstrate the software we used a spinning disk confocal system ([http://www.yokogawa.com/scanner/products/csuX1e.htm Yokogawa]/[http://www.solameretech.com/ Solamere]) equipped with a [http://www.photometrics.com/products/emccdcams/evolve/512.php Photometrics Evolve 512] camera, [http://www.asiimaging.com/ ASI] XYZ and piezo Z-stage on the new [http://www.asiimaging.com/products/video-microscopes-test-stands-complete-system-solutions/rapid-automated-modular-microscope-ramm-system/ ASI RAMM Microscope], multi-color laser launch and AOTF ([http://www.solameretech.com/ Solamere]), [http://www.esimaging.co.uk/products ESImaging] micro-controller, and running on a PC computer. All of the equipment was made available to us by the respective companies (Thanks!). 

For fast image acquisition, a triggering mechanism was set-up, resulting in continuous acquisition at a rate limited only by the frame rate. The triggering was made possible by synchronization of the camera, AOTF and z-piezo stage. A TTL pulse, which signals when the camera is exposing, was used to drive a sequence of different output patterns on the [http://www.esimaging.co.uk/products ESImaing] micro-controller as well as the piezo controller. Rapid control of the z-piezo stage was very beneficial for maintaining focus while running the Slide Explorer plugin.

At each time point, a z-stack of 5 slices (with 2 micron intervals) was acquired. Exposure time was 50 msec, total time to acquire a single time point (10 images) was less than 700 msec. </font>

We were very encouraged by the interest and very positive response both from the user community and from the industry. On the ASCB exhibit floor we noted Micro-Manager controlling equipments in the booths of Spectral, [http://www.raptorphotonics.com/search.php Raptor Photonics], [http://www.axiomoptics.com/index_Events.html Axiom Optics], [http://www.sutter.com/index.html Sutter Instrument], [http://www.thorlabs.us/Navigation.cfm?section=7 ThorLabs], and [http://biobus.org/ BioBus]. Thanks everyone for stopping by at our booth and for all the support our project is getting from the industry! A special Thanks to George Peeters for all the help in set up and take down.
