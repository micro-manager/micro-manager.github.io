The algorithm is a constrained, iterative approach for solving the L2 regularization of an ill-posed  problem to determine the positive fluorescence distribution that minimizes the equation where g is the observed  3-D fluorescence data, f is the underlying 3-dimensional fluorescence distribution, h is the 3-D point-spread function and * denotes convolution. Thus, the algorithm finds the fluorescence distribution that minimizes a weighted combination of the least-squares fit to the observed data (the total squared residuals) and the total squared intensity of the distribution (a measure of "smoothness"), with Î± the weighting factor that determines the smoothness of the resulting distribution. The software implements an iterative conjugate-gradient  method to minimize a related function that has the same minimum, is strictly convex, and is twice differentiable, and the method is guaranteed to converge (Carrington, et al., 1995). Convergence is assumed when the (normalized) first derivative is "small" and the algorithm automatically stops.
