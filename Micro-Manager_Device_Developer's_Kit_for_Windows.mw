The Device Developer's Kit contains all source code and instructions required for building Micro-Manager device adapters. The major version number corresponds to the matching Micro-Manager Device API version. Using this kit you can build device adapters completely independent of the rest of the Micro-Manager code base, i.e. without the need to set up complicated build environments, or to understand or access MMCore and user interface source code.

As well as downloading and installing the Device Developer's Kit (installer downloads below), you will need to read the instruction manual: [[Building Micro-Manager Device Adapters]].
