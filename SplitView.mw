There are some devices on the market that can split an image into 2 (or more) wavelength components and project these side by side on a camera (examples are the [http://www.magbiosystems.com/products/DV2.php Dual View] and the [http://www.cairn-research.co.uk/Products/Fluorescence/Fluorescence20II20Splitter OptoSplit]). The SplitView plugin (under the '''Plugins | SplitView''' menu entry) will display the acquired images as a two channel Image in the 5D-Image viewer. You can set the color of each channel and use either a left-right or top-bottom split.
