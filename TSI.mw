== Installation Instructions ==

This adapter is compatible with all Thorlabs Scientific Imaging cameras (TSI). Before configuring the camera with micro-manager, [https://www.thorlabs.com/software_pages/ViewSoftwarePage.cfm?Code=ThorCam ThorCam] software must be installed and verified to operate as intended. After installing ThorCam software make sure that camera is fully functional and that it can acquire both in single image and live streaming mode.

Make sure that both micro-manager and any Thorlabs camera related software is shut down. Locate all files in the ThorCam/Scientific Camera Support/Scientific Camera Interfaces/SDK/Native Compact Scientific Camera Toolkit/dlls/Native_64_lib (or Native_32_lib for 32-bit OS) directory and copy them into the micro-manager installation directory.

After that the camera should be ready for configuration with micro-manager. Start micro-manager and select Tools | Hardware Configuration Wizard command to add TSI camera to the configuration.

At step 2 (Add or Remove Devices) of the Wizard, scroll Available Devices list to *TSI*. There should be only one device available: TSICam. Select TSICam and add to the configuration. You will be prompted to enter the camera ID. Default is "0" and leave it at that. Multiple cameras on the same computer are not currently supported.

After adding the TSICam device, proceed to next steps of the Hardware Configuration Wizard as described in the micro-manager documentation.

=== Legacy Camera Support ===

If you have one of the legacy camera models (consult Thorlabs support if you are not sure) this driver should work. Verify that TSI_SDK.dll file is present in the micro-manager directory. However, you can not have both legacy and standard cameras connected with the same computer.
